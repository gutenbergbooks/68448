<span class="smaller">THE UNEXPECTED MAN</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">A week</span> before the day set for her wedding, in
a bright hour of early April, Hera rode forth from
the park of Villa Barbiondi. Following the margin
of the river, she trotted her horse to where the
shores lay coupled by a bridge of pontoons&mdash;an
ancient device of small boats and planking little
different from the sort Cæsar’s soldiers threw
across the same stream. She drew up and watched
the strife going on between the bridge and the
current&mdash;the boats straining at their anchor-chains
and the water rioting between them.</p>

<p>Italy has no lovelier valley than the one where
flowed the river on which she looked, and in the
gentler season there is no water-course more expressive
of serene human character. But the river
was tipsy to-day. The springtime sun, in its passages
of splendour from Alp to Alp, had set free<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
the winter snows, and Old Adda, flushed by his
many cups, frolicked ruthlessly to the sea.</p>

<p>Peasant folk in that part of the Brianza had
smiled a few days earlier to see the great stream
change its sombre green for an earthy hue, because
it was a promise of the vernal awakening. Yet
their joy was shadowed, as it always is in freshet
days, by dread of the havoc so often attending the
spree of the waters.</p>

<p>Time and again Hera had ridden over when the
river was in such mood, and known only a keen
enjoyment in the adventure. Now she spoke to
Nero, and he went forward without distrust in
the hand that guided him; still, the pose of his
ears and the quivering nostrils betrayed a preference
for roads that neither swayed nor billowed.
Less than half the crossing had been accomplished
when the crackle of sundering timber startled
her; then events confused themselves strangely
amid the rustle of the wind and the scream of the
water.</p>

<p>A few paces ahead, at the middle of the stream,
where the current’s play was fiercest, two pontoons
tore free from their anchorage, and here the
bridge parted. With her consciousness of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
rose the blurred vision of a horse and rider flying
over the breach. Then she was aware of the beat
of swift-moving hoofs, and, in the next instant,
it seemed, of a voice at her side:</p>

<p>“Turn back, signora, I beg of you!”</p>

<p>She brought her horse around, but while she
did so there was a second rending of woodwork,
a snapping, too, of anchor-chains, and the part of
the bridge on which they stood&mdash;severed by a new
breach from the rest of the structure&mdash;began to
go with the tide.</p>

<p>It was an odd bark on which they found themselves
being swept toward the sea. It consisted of
six of the pontoons, held together none too securely
by the planking that made the deck.</p>

<p>Round and round it swung, tossed like a chip
on the racing flood. The temper of Hera’s horse
was less equal to the swirling, rocking situation
than that of her companion’s mount. In vain she
tried to quiet him. From side to side of the raft
the beast caracoled or rose with fore legs in the
air when she drew him up, perilously near the
edge.</p>

<p>“Dismount, dismount!” the other called to her.</p>

<p>Before she could heed the warning Nero began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
to back near the brink, leaving her powerless to
prevent him carrying her into the water. But the
stranger had swung out of the saddle. A spring
forward and he had Nero by the head in a grip not
to be shaken off. The animal’s effort to go overboard
was checked, but only for the moment, and
when Hera had dismounted her deliverer passed
his own bridle-reins to her that he might be free
to manage her more restive steed.</p>

<p>“There, there, boy!” he said in the way to quiet
a nervous horse. “No fear, no fear. We shall be
out of this soon. Patience! Steady, steady!”</p>

<p>A minute and he had Nero under such control
that he stood with four hoofs on the deck at one
time and balked only fitfully at the restraining
hand on the bridle.</p>

<p>Silently Hera watched the man at his task,
struck by the calmness with which he performed
it. By neither look nor word did he betray to her
that fear had any place in his emotions. Swifter
the river tossed them onward. Louder their
crazy vessel creaked and groaned. But his
mastery of himself, his superiority to the terrors
that bounded them, his disdain for the hazard
of events while he did the needful work of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
moment, awoke in her a feeling akin to security.
It was as if he lifted her with him above the
danger in which the maddest whim of fortune
had made them partners.</p>

<p>“Do you see any way out of it?” she asked,
presently, following his example of coolness.</p>

<p>He seemed not to hear her voice. With feet
set sure and a steady grip on the bridle, he peered
into the distance ahead&mdash;far over the expanse of
violent water, now tinted here and there with
rose, caught from the glowing west, where the
sun hung low over dark, wooded hills. She wondered
what it was that he sought so eagerly, but
did not ask. She guessed it had to do with some
quickly conceived design for breaking their captivity,
and when at length he turned to her she
saw in his eye the light of a discovered hope.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “we have a good chance. The
current bears us toward the point at the bend of
the river. We must pass within a few yards of
that if I judge rightly.”</p>

<p>“And then?”</p>

<p>“I shall make use of that,” he answered, pointing
to a coil of rope that hung on his saddle-bow.</p>

<p>“What I mean to do is&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>The sound of breaking planks signalled a danger
with which he had not reckoned. He saw one of
the end pontoons wrench itself free. Hera saw it
too, as it bore away to drift alone; and they knew
it for a warning grimly clear that all the members
of their uncertain bark must part company ere
long.</p>

<p>In the silence that fell between them she looked
toward the Viadetta bank, where peasants awoke
the echoes with their hue and cry. He kept his
gaze on the spear of land that marked the river’s
sharpest turn. Once or twice he measured with
his eye the lessening distance between them and
the shore.</p>

<p>“We hold to the right course,” he said, confidently.
“There will be time.”</p>

<p>Piece by piece Hera saw the thing that bore
them scatter its parts over the river.</p>

<p>“What shall we do?” she asked, a shudder of
fear mingling strangely with trust in him.</p>

<p>At first he made her no answer, but continued
to watch the shore as if striving to discern some
signal. Another pontoon broke loose, carrying
off a part of the deck and leaving the rest of the
planks it had supported hanging in the water.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
The sound of the breaking timbers did not make
him turn his head. When at last he faced her it
was to speak in tones all at odds with their
desperate state.</p>

<p>“See the Old Sentinel!” he exclaimed, gleefully.
“He shall save us!”</p>

<p>Not far to the south she could see the projecting
land, a flat place and bare except for some carved
stones lying there in a semblance of order&mdash;the
bleached ruins, in fact, of a temple raised by one
of her ancestors. The wash of ages had brought
the river much nearer than it was in the days of
that rude conqueror, and one stone, bedded deep
in the mould, stood erect at the water’s edge. Its
base was hidden, but enough remained above
ground to tell what part it had played in architecture&mdash;a
section of a rounded column. Brianza
folk knew it by the name of the Old Sentinel.
Always it had been there, they told the stranger.
Now the magic of the low sun changed it into a
shaft of gold. From childhood Hera had known
the ancient landmark, and was the more puzzled
to divine how it could serve them now.</p>

<p>“Can I help?” she asked, as he turned toward
her again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered, quickly. “Hold my horse.
Can you manage both?”</p>

<p>“I will try,” she said, moving closer to him.</p>

<p>“We must not lose the horses,” he warned her.
“They will be useful in case I&mdash;even after we are
connected once more with the land.”</p>

<p>She took the other bridle, which he passed to
her, and grasped it firmly. Then she saw him lift
from the saddle-bow the rope&mdash;a lariat of the
plainsman’s sort, fashioned of horsehair, light of
weight, but stronger than if made of hemp. He
gathered it in an orderly coil and made sure of his
footing. Now she knew what he was going to
attempt, and the desperate chance of the feat
came home to her. In a flash she comprehended
that upon the success of it their lives depended
even if the dismembering raft held together so
long. If his aim proved false, if the lariat missed
the mark, a second throw might not avail; before
he could make it they must be swept past the
column of stone.</p>

<p>Calmly he awaited the right moment, which
came when their rickety outfit, in the freak of the
current, was moving yet toward the land. He
poised a second and raised the coil. Twice he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
swung it in a circle above his head&mdash;the horses
were watching him&mdash;and with a mighty fling sent
it over the water. Steadily it paid out, ring for
ring, straight as an arrow’s course, until the noose
caught the column fairly, spread around it, and
dropped to the ground.</p>

<p>“Bravo, Signor Sentinella!” he cried, pulling
the line taut. “A good catch!”</p>

<p>“Bravo, Signor&mdash;” she amended, pausing for
his name.</p>

<p>“Forza is my name,” he said, hauling for the
shore, hand over hand.</p>

<p>It was work that had to be done quickly. A
few seconds and their craft would swing past the
column to which it was moored. To haul it back
then would mean a tug against the current. In
this he knew that no strength of his could avail
even if the lariat did not part. His sole chance
was to keep the float moving in a slanting line
toward land before it should be carried beyond
the Sentinel. The bulk of woodwork and pontoons
was of great weight, and the task took all
the strength he could muster.</p>

<p>“Let me help you,” Hera said, seeing that he
strained every muscle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>“No, no! Hold the horses! Now is our time.
We are in shallow water.”</p>

<p>He looped the rope about his right hand, and
with this alone held them to the shore. Kneeling
on the half-submerged planks at the edge, he
leaned over the water, and, with his left hand,
passed the end of the lariat under and around a
yet staunch timber of the deck. In his teeth he
caught the end and held it; then clutched it again
in his free hand, and, with the quick movement
of one sure of his knot, made it fast.</p>

<p>“Now for it,” he said, on his feet once more, as
their raft, tugging hard at the line, swung around
with the current, and another pontoon broke
away.</p>

<p>Before she was aware of his purpose he had
lifted her into the saddle and mounted his own
horse.</p>

<p>“Come along,” he said, cheerfully. “It is only
wet feet at the worst,” and he put spur to his
horse.</p>

<p>Their animals sprang into the water together
just as the lariat snapped, and the raft, set
free, went on with the rushing flood. Side
by side they splashed their way to the pebbled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
beach and up to where the ruins of Alboin’s
temple reposed.</p>

<p>Before them was a ride in the growing dusk
over open lengths of hillside pass and by sylvan
roads to Villa Barbiondi. On high the wind blew
swiftly; clouds that had lost their lustre raced
away, and the shadows fell long on hills that were
dull and bare as yet, but soon to be lightened with
passionate blossoming. Before her, in the gloaming
distance, were glimpses over the trees of her
father’s dark-walled house&mdash;a grand old villa, impressive
by contrast with its trim white neighbours
pointing the perspective. Glad to feel solid ground
beneath their hoofs once more, the horses galloped
away, and their riders let them go. Not until the
partial darkness of a grove enclosed them did
they slacken speed; there the road wore upward,
and the horses of their will came to a walk. Beyond
the black stocks and naked boughs the crimson
glow of sunset lingered.</p>

<p>“Now that it is past,” Hera said, as if musing,
“I see how great was the danger.”</p>

<p>“I think you were alive to it at the time,” he
returned in the manner of one who had observed
and judged. “You are brave.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>“It was confidence more than bravery,” she
told him frankly.</p>

<p>“But you made it easy for me to do my part,”
he insisted.</p>

<p>“That was because&mdash;well, as I see it now&mdash;because
there was no moment when I did not feel
that we should come out of it all right.”</p>

<p>“Then I must tell you,” he said, “to whom we
are indebted for our escape. Somewhere in the
woods, the fields, or the highways on the other
side of the river is a Guernsey heifer living just
now in the joy or sorrow of newly gained freedom.
But for that we might not be here in fairly
dry clothes.”</p>

<p>They had emerged from the grove, and he
pointed toward the opposite shore, where the
white buildings of the Social Dairy were still
visible, though the twilight was almost gone.</p>

<p>“The heifer was born and bred in our little
colony over there,” he went on, “and until an
hour ago her world was bounded by its fences.
But she jumped our tallest barrier, and I was
after her with the lariat when the bridge broke.”</p>

<p>“I admit our debt to the heifer,” she said,
laughing. “To her we owe the rope&mdash;but not the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
throwing. I was unaware that anyone short of
the American cowboy could wield a lasso so well.”</p>

<p>“It was in America that I got an inkling of the
art,” he explained. “Once the life of a California
ranchero seemed to me the one all desirable&mdash;a
dream which I pursued even to the buying of a
ranch.”</p>

<p>“And the awakening?” she asked, a little preoccupied.
His reference to the Social Dairy had
solved for her the riddle of his identity. She knew
him now for the leader of a certain radical group
in the Chamber of Deputies.</p>

<p>“The awakening came soon enough,” he said.
“At the end of two years the gentleman of whom
I bought the dream consented to take it back at
a handsome profit to himself.”</p>

<p>“Then you paid dearly, I am afraid, for your
lessons in lariat throwing.”</p>

<p>“I thought so until to-day,” he replied, turning
to meet her eyes.</p>

<p>They rode on at a smarter gait. She had looked
into his clear face, and it seemed boyish for one
of whom the world heard so much&mdash;for the leader
of Italy’s most serious political cause. He was,
like her, a noble type of the North’s blue-eyed race;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
only the blood of some dark-hued genitor told in
his hair and color, while her massing tresses had
the caprice of gold. They came to a hill and the
horses walked again.</p>

<p>“My deliverer, it appears, is Mario Forza, the
dangerous man,” she said, with a playful accent of
dismay.</p>

<p>“Yes; the title is one with which my friends the
enemy have honoured me.”</p>

<p>She leaned forward and patted her horse, saying
the while:</p>

<p>“I have it in mind from some writer that to
dangerous men the world owes its progress.”</p>

<p>“Do you believe that?” he asked, seriously.</p>

<p>“Yes; in the way that I understand it. Perhaps
I do not get the true meaning of my author.”</p>

<p>“One can never be certain of knowing the
thought of another,” he said.</p>

<p>“True. For example, I am far from certain
that I know the thought of your New
Democracy&mdash;what you are striving to do for
Italy. And yet,” she added, reflectively, “I
think I know.”</p>

<p>“Do you understand that we aim to fill our
country with true friends&mdash;to teach Italy that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
is possible for all her children to live and prosper
in their own land?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered, positively, gladly.</p>

<p>“Then you know the thought of the New
Democracy.”</p>

<p>Evincing an interest that he felt was not
feigned, she asked him how the cause fared, and
he told her that among the people it gained, but
in Parliament set-backs, discouragements, were
almost the rule.</p>

<p>“But you will fight on!” she exclaimed, out of
the conviction he gave her of valour.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes; we shall fight on.”</p>

<p>The hush of the night’s first moments had fallen
upon the scene. What light tarried in the west
showed the mountain’s contour, but relieved the
darkness no longer. Yellow windows studded
the lower plains and the woody heights. They
could see above the trees the shadowy towers of
Villa Barbiondi, and only a little way before them
now, but still invisible, stood the gates of the
villa park.</p>

<p>They had reached the foot of a sharp rise in the
road when two blazing orbs shot over the crest of
the hill, bathing horses and riders in a stream of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
light. A motor car came to a standstill, and the
older of the two occupants, a tall man in the
fifties, sprang down nimbly.</p>

<p>“Hera! Hera!” he cried. “Heaven be praised!”</p>

<p>As he approached he snatched a mask from his
face, and there was her father, Don Riccardo.</p>

<p>“And to think that you are here, all of
you, safe as ever!” he exclaimed, caressing
her hand. “Ah, my daughter, this is a joyous
moment.”</p>

<p>“Yes; all of me saved, <i>babbo</i> dear,” she said.
“But indeed it came near being the other way.”</p>

<p>“Again Heaven be praised!” said Don Riccardo.</p>

<p>“Heaven and this gentleman,” Hera amended,
turning to Mario. “The Honourable Forza&mdash;my
father.”</p>

<p>“Your hand, sir!” cried Don Riccardo, going
around her horse to where Mario stood. “Believe
me, you have saved my life as well. My debt to
you is so great that I can never hope to pay.”</p>

<p>Mario told him that it was not such a big debt.
“In plain truth,” he added, “I was obliged to
save Donna Hera in order to save myself. So it
was the sort of activity, you see, that comes
under the head of self-preservation.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, is it so?” returned Don Riccardo, genially.
“Nevertheless, sir, I shall look further into your
report of the affair. To-night I shall sound it. In
your presence we shall have the testimony of an
eyewitness. At least we shall if you will give us
your company at dinner, which, by the way, is
waiting.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry, but to-night I cannot.”</p>

<p>“Then to-morrow, or Wednesday, Thursday,
Friday?”</p>

<p>“Wednesday I should be glad.”</p>

<p>“Good! On Wednesday, then, we shall tarnish
your fame for veracity, and, if I mistake not,
brighten it for modesty.”</p>

<p>The final tones of the sunset’s colours had given
way to deepest shadow. At Hera’s side, listening
to her account of the river episode, stood Don
Riccardo’s companion of the motor car&mdash;a dark,
bearded man of middle height, whose face was
hard and cruel, and seemed the more so in the
grim flare of the machine’s lamps.</p>

<p>“Signor Tarsis!” Don Riccardo called to him.
“Let me present you. The Honourable Forza.
Probably you have met.”</p>

<p>Tarsis, drawing nearer, gave Mario no more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
a half nod of recognition, while he said, in a manner
of one merely observing the civilities:</p>

<p>“I have to thank you for the service I hear you
have rendered my affianced wife.”</p>

<p>There was a pause before Mario replied that he
counted it a great privilege to be at hand in the
moment of Donna Hera’s need. The last word
was still on his lips when Tarsis turned to Don
Riccardo and asked if he were ready to go back
to the villa, and the older man answered with a
bare affirmative. Presently the car was brought
about; as it shot away Hera and Mario followed.
Now and again the highway bore close to the
river’s margin, and the splash of the rampant
water sounded in the dark. A little while and they
stopped at the Barbiondi gates, where their ways
parted&mdash;hers up the winding road to the house,
his onward to the nearest bridge, that he might
cross and ride back to Viadetta.</p>

<p>“I regret that I cannot be with you to-night,”
he told her. “An hour and I must start for Rome.”</p>

<p>“Until Wednesday, then?” she said, giving him
her hand.</p>

<p>“Until Wednesday.”</p>

<p>She spoke to Nero and was gone. A moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
Forza lingered, looking into the darkness that
enveloped her. Once or twice, as she moved up
the road, he caught the sparking of her horse’s
steel. At a turn in the way she passed into the
light of the motor car’s lamps, and he gained one
more glimpse of her, and was content. Then he
set off for the Bridge of Speranza.</p>

<span class="smaller">TARSIS</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the chieftains of production who were
leading Italy to prosperity and power Antonio
Tarsis held the foremost place. Son of a shop-keeper
in Palermo, he began life poor and without
influence. It had taken him less than twenty
years to build up a fortune so large that the
journals of new ideals pointed to it as a terrible
example. Cartoonists had fallen into the habit of
picturing him with a snout and bristled ears.
There was a serious portrait of him in the directors’
room of one of the companies he ruled. It was
painted by a man whose impulse to please was
stronger than his artistic courage. He told all that
he dared. In full length, it showed a man under
forty, black-bearded, with a well-turned person of
middle height; small, adroit eyes heavily browed,
prominent nose inclined to squatness, spare lips
and broad jaws; the portrait, at a glance, of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
fighter of firm grain, fashioned for success in the
great battle.</p>

<p>So much for the Tarsis of paint and canvas.
The one that faced you in the flesh had harder,
crueler eyes; the living clutch of the lips was
tighter; the faint yet redeeming human quality of
the man in the picture was lacking. And in the
hue of his skin, much darker than the painter had
ventured, nature did not deny the land of his
birth&mdash;Sicily. It was there, at the beginning of
manhood, that chance threw him into the post of
time-keeper for a silk-mill. He did his work so
well that never a centesimo went to pay for
moments not spent in the service of the company.</p>

<p>One morning Tarsis, at the door with book and
pencil ready, waited in vain for the workers to
arrive; and his career as a great factor in Italy’s
industrial life may be dated from the week that
followed, when he assembled gangs of strike-breakers
to replace the men and women who had
joined in a revolt against many wrongs. A strike-breaker
he had been ever since. By laying low the
will of others, men or masters of men, and setting
up his own will, he had gained over human
destinies a dominion so practical that he cared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
little for the theory of king and Parliament. Of
small import was it who made the laws or who
executed them so long as they did not take from
him the power to decide what share a worker
should have of the product of his hand.</p>

<p>For a year or two Tarsis worked at his trade of
strike-breaking in the United States, and that was
the making of him, so far as external things had to
do with the man. He brought back to Sicily some
money-winning ideas about manufacturing that
lifted him into the place of superintendent of the
silk-mill, and some notions about “high finance”
that he picked up bore rich fruit. One day the
company found itself reorganized, with Tarsis in
command. That was his first big victory. He
followed it up in due time by laying siege to the
large silk makers of the North. His campaign
took the form of a proposal to unite their works
with those of the South. At first they greeted his
project with smiles, but Tarsis played one company
against the other so craftily that in the end, obeying
the law of self-preservation, all were eager to
join the union.</p>

<p>As master mind of the general company Tarsis
smashed the idols of custom, tore down everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
that retarded the making of money. The methods
of generations went by the board. He struck out
for new fields, and quickly Italy’s product of spun
silk was feeding the looms of Russia, Austria,
Great Britain, and the United States in quantities
double those of the old days. Mills were set
up at places easily reached by the farmer with
his cocoons or near to shipping points. At Venice
he turned an ancient palace into a buzzing hive
and sent forth smoke and steam over the Grand
Canal. There were unions of shoe factories, glass
and carriage works, steamboat lines, and steel-mills;
and never was Antonio Tarsis a factor unless
a factor that controlled. The journals of the New
Democracy muttered, and likened him to creatures
of the brute world noted for their ability to reach
or swallow.</p>

<p>One of the things Tarsis learned in the United
States was that child labour in factories is a superior
device for fattening stock dividends. Mario Forza,
from his place in the National Parliament, once
denounced him in a speech rebuking the Government
for lack of interest in the toiling masses.
The bodily health and moral being of thousands
of children were ruined every year in Italy, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
said, that men like Tarsis might pile up their
absurd fortunes&mdash;an outburst that brought loud
and long applause from the seats of the New
Democrats. This speech was green in the memory
of Tarsis that night on the riverside when
he thanked Forza for the service rendered his
promised wife.</p>

<p>A situation created by the want of money had
brought Hera and Tarsis together. He had some
cold-blooded reasons for wanting the beautiful
patrician for his wife. She ministered to his sense
of beauty, but it was the principle of success she
typified that gave her greatest value in his eyes.
The man of peasant blood looked to an alliance
with the house of Barbiondi as the crowning
triumph of his career. Hera was the fairest prize
of the Lombard aristocracy. Men of noble blood
and large fortune had failed to win her hand,
because she could not rid herself of the conviction
that to become the wife of a man for the sake of
his fortune would be a mere bartering of her
charms. Against such a step her whole being
rose in revolt.</p>

<p>Tarsis had conceived the thought to possess
her and had planned to do so as he had planned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
to gain control of the Mediterranean Steamship
Line. His faithful ally was Donna Beatrice, Hera’s
aunt, who strove mightily in the cause. But it was
Hera’s love for her father&mdash;her wish to relieve
him from the torments of poverty&mdash;that made it
possible for Tarsis to attain his purpose. The
sands of the Barbiondi were almost run. Their
villa, built two centuries before Napoleon appeared
on that side of the Alps, was all that remained of
an estate once the largest in the North. Charts of
old days show its forests and hillside fields bordering
the river Adda from Lake Lecco in the
mountains clear to the Bridge of Lodi. Like his
forebears of many generations, Don Riccardo had
seen the money-lenders swallow his substance. If
in his own time the bites were of necessity small,
they were none the less frequent. To Donna Beatrice’s
skill in concealing the actual state of their
purse was due the fact that the Barbiondi were
able to spend a part of the winter in Milan, so that
Hera, whom her aunt recognised as the family’s last
asset, might be in evidence to the fashionable
world. How she accomplished this never ceased to
be a riddle to her brother; and he gave it up, as he
gave up all riddles. His idea of a master stroke in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
contrivance was to go to his banker and arrange
another mortgage. He was likely to go shooting
or for a ride when there was a financial crisis to
be met. It was at the moment that the mortgagee’s
mouth watered for the last morsel that
Hera, in the purest spirit of self-sacrifice, consented
to a marriage with Tarsis.</p>

<p>Matchmakers of Milan’s fashionable world, who
had known that the Tarsis millions were knocking
at the Barbiondi gate, received the announcement
of the betrothal as the extinguishment of their
last hope, but in the world of creditors there was
a wild rejoicing. The mortgagee lost his appetite
for the last morsel of the estate. Milliners, makers
of gowns and boots, purveyors of food and drink,
sent in humble prayers for patronage instead of
angry demands for pay. Everywhere the bloodhounds
of debt slunk off the scent.</p>

<p>A day of mid-April was chosen for the wedding,
and as it drew near Hera retained her studied air
of cheerfulness, that Don Riccardo might not
divine the price his peace of mind demanded of
her. She rode about the countryside, sometimes
with her father, oftener alone, while the task of
preparation for the nuptials went forward under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
the willing hand of Aunt Beatrice. To that contented
woman the bride-elect’s lukewarm interest
in the affair was a source of wonder. With eyes
uplifted and hands clasped she paused now and
then to ask if ever Heaven had given an aunt a
niece of such scant enthusiasm. Such was the
situation the day that Hera had her adventure
on the river. No experience of life had dwelt so
pleasantly in her thought as the meeting and converse
with Mario Forza. No coming event had
ever interested her so warmly as that he was
going to dine in Villa Barbiondi&mdash;that she was
going to meet him again.</p>

<p>She spent the closing hours of Wednesday afternoon
at her window looking over the river toward
the fields and buildings of the Social Dairy. She
saw one herd after another wind its way homeward
up the pass and watched eagerly for the coming
forth of Mario. When the file of poplars that bordered
the highway by the river were casting their
longest shadows she saw him ride out and begin
the descent of the hill. For some time she was
able to keep him in view as he trotted his horse
along the level road. When he came upon the
Bridge of Speranza&mdash;the waters had not ended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
their spree&mdash;she was conscious of a new anxiety,
and when he had gained the nearer shore she felt
a strange relief. A little while and the shadows of
the poplars were neither short nor long, and
darkness hid him from sight. Presently the voice
of her father, raised in welcome, mingled with the
most genial tones of Donna Beatrice, sounding up
the staircase, told her that he had arrived.</p>

<p>“Ha, my friend!” she heard Don Riccardo
saying, “this is the greatest of delights. Why,
I knew your father, sir. The Marquis and I
served the old king. And a gay service it was
for blades who knew how to be gay. Magnificent
old days!”</p>

<p>“I heard much of you, Don Riccardo, from my
father,” Mario said.</p>

<p>“And I have heard much of you since you came
to Milan,” the other returned. “But I never
recognised you without the title; nor in the dim
light of the other night did I see my old comrade
in your face. But I see him now. By my faith!
you take me back thirty years. And pictures of
you&mdash;marvellous pictures&mdash;have I seen in the
newspapers. I remember one in particular,” he
ran on, a gleam in his eye. “It portrayed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
Honourable Forza in action, if you please. I think
he was performing a feat no more difficult than
getting out of a carriage; but the camera immortalised
him as an expert in the art of standing
on one foot and placing the other in his overcoat
pocket.”</p>

<p>Hera was with them now joining in the laughter.
Donna Beatrice thanked Mario effusively for saving
the life of Hera. The more she had reflected on the
deed the more heroic it had grown in her sight.
Her gratitude had its golden grain, for the fact
loomed large to her mind that but for his timely
action there might have been no forthcoming
marriage with Antonio Tarsis, no saving of the
Barbiondi ship. She was prodigal in her praise of
his knightly valour, as she called it, and declared
that the age of chivalry still lived. At this point
a footman came to Mario’s rescue by announcing
that the vermouth was served.</p>

<p>“And what of the progress toward peace in the
human family, Honourable?” asked Don Riccardo,
merrily, as they took their places at table.</p>

<p>Mario answered that the progress, as to the
branch of the human family known as Italian,
was for the time being somewhat backward. “The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
trouble with our party,” he said, “is that we can’t
break ourselves of the habit of being right at the
wrong time. Our foes are better strategists.
They are wise enough to be wrong at the right
time.”</p>

<p>“And what is this New Democracy all about,
Signor Forza?” asked Donna Beatrice, as she might
have asked concerning some doing on the island of
Guam.</p>

<p>“It is an effort to mend a social machine that is
badly out of repair,” he answered. “The hewer of
wood is demanding a fire, the drawer of water a
drink. The producer is striving to keep a little
more of what he produces.”</p>

<p>He held up a side of the industrial picture that
was the reverse of what Don Riccardo’s prospective
son-in-law liked to present. His words
did not square with Tarsis’s assertion that the
heart of a statesman should be in his head. He
gave reasons why some are rich and some are poor,
and though new to those at the table, they felt
that they were listening to no sentimental dreamer.
He struck the key-note of the century’s new
thought. If his head did lift itself toward the
clouds at times, his feet remained firmly planted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
on the earth, and his ideals were those of a man
determined to be useful in the world.</p>

<p>It was good, Hera thought, to look upon him;
good to hear his voice, good to feel that one admired
him. And Donna Beatrice, looking over the
rims of her pince-nez, was seized with alarm. Their
guest’s discourse might be interesting, she told
herself, but she was positive there was nothing in
it to command such wrapt attention on the part
of her niece. When they had risen, and Mario
and Hera were leading the way to the reception
hall, she pulled at her brother’s coat sleeve to
hold him in the alcoved passage; and, standing
there amid the tapestries and trophies of shields
and arms, the poor woman made known her
doubts and fears.</p>

<p>“Riccardo, what does this mean? I say it is
most extraordinary.”</p>

<p>“Yes, the coffee was not delicious,” he observed.
“The cook is drinking absinthe again.”</p>

<p>“The coffee! I speak of Hera.”</p>

<p>“In what has she offended now?” he inquired,
clasping his hands behind him and looking up at
an ancestral portrait dim with the centuries.</p>

<p>“You ask that?” she rejoined sceptically.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
“But no; it is impossible that even a man could
be so blind. I thank Heaven Antonio Tarsis was
not present.”</p>

<p>“I always thank Heaven when he is not present,”
Don Riccardo confessed, and his sister
winced. “What crime has Hera committed?”</p>

<p>“On the eve of her marriage she is showing a
scandalous interest in a man who is not to be
her husband.”</p>

<p>Don Riccardo gave a low laugh of depreciation.
“Mario Forza saved her life,” he reminded her.
“If the fact has slipped your memory, it is not so
with Hera.”</p>

<p>“I know,” Donna Beatrice argued, “but there
are things to remember as well as things not to
forget.”</p>

<p>“My dear sister, let our girl indulge this natural
sentiment of thankfulness.”</p>

<p>“Thankfulness?” the other questioned, raising
her brows.</p>

<p>“And what else? Come, my Beatrice, the strain
of this wedding business has wrought upon your
nerves. When the fuss is over you must go to the
Adriatic for a rest.”</p>

<p>She said it was considerate of him, but she did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
not feel the need of rest. In a corner of the reception
hall they found Hera at the piano, Mario
beside her, turning the page. They asked him to
sing, and he began a ballad of the grape harvest
in Tuscany. It pictured the beauty of the rich
clusters, the sun-burned cheeks and rugged mirth
of the peasant maids, stolen kisses, troths plighted,
and the ruby vintage drunk at the wedding feast.
The song was manly and sung in a manly voice.</p>

<p>While his clear baritone filled the room and
Hera played the accompaniment the feelings of
Don Riccardo were stirred deeply. From his chair
by the wall he looked sadly upon his daughter and
his old comrade’s son, and hoped, for her sake, that
what might have given him gladness at one time
would not happen now. The words of his sister
had moved him more than he let her know. What
if Mario Forza had come into her heart? What if
the marriage to which she was to go should prove
the funeral of a true love? What if that were
added to the price she was going to pay for helping
her father? His impulse was to take her in his
arms, tell her to accept any happiness that destiny
had to offer, and defy the issue whatever it might
be. Instead, he rang for a glass of cognac.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>When Hera had sung a romance of old Siena
Don Riccardo asked Mario about that “idealistic
experiment,” the Social Dairy, and learned that
it was no longer an experiment, but a prosperous
object lesson for those willing to listen to
the New Democracy. Mario told them a little of
the life of the place, and Don Riccardo suggested
that they all go and see for themselves.</p>

<p>“It would give me pleasure,” Mario assured
him.</p>

<p>“I should like to go very much,” Hera said.</p>

<p>“Then we shall visit you to-morrow.” Don
Riccardo decided, with an enthusiasm which Aunt
Beatrice did not share.</p>

<span class="smaller">A DREAM REALISED</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following afternoon Mario, on horseback,
appeared at the villa and said he had stopped to
accompany the Barbiondi in their ride to the
Social Dairy. It was a proffer Donna Beatrice
could not regard with favour. From the first the
trip across the river had seemed to her a project
of questionable taste; but now that it was to include
the company of a man in whom Hera
had betrayed a “scandalous interest,” it stood
in her mind as a distinctly improper proceeding.
Drawing her brother aside, she said as much to
him while they waited for the horses to be brought
from the stables.</p>

<p>But Don Riccardo failed to view the affair in
that light. He was glad to see Forza, and glad of
the opportunity the three-mile ride afforded for a
chat with the son of his old comrade. His expectation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
in regard to the chat, however, was not
realised, for what Aunt Beatrice pronounced a
shocking display of indiscretion on the part of
her niece occurred before they had reached the
Bridge of Speranza. When the cavalcade, after
a brisk trot, had dropped into a walk, Hera and
Mario fell behind and rode side by side. And
in the rest of the journey Donna Beatrice could
not see that they made any appreciable effort
to lessen the distance separating them from the
others.</p>

<p>The day was a true one of the freakish month.
In the morning hours the clouds had played their
many games, now gambolling on the blue in
fleecy flocks, now rolling sublimely in great white
billows or tumbling in darker shapes that shed big
drops of rain. But the present hour was one of
purest sky, and all the land was gloried in sunshine.
Mysterious heralds of the springtime spoke
to the spirit and senses of the younger riders.
The river was in gentler mood; the grey brush of
the poplars no longer strained in the wind, maple
twigs were dimpling with buds, and the green
mantle of the hills seemed to grow brighter with
every glance. Their cheeks were smoothed by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
new breath that comes stealing over the land in
April days. They talked of the things about them.
Hera rejoiced in the life of the outer air. She
knew the wild growths and the architecture of the
birds, and he, if saddened easily by the ugliness
men impart to life, was ever awake to the beauties
of the world. They saw here and there a last
year’s nest in the leafing branches.</p>

<p>“There was the home of an ortolan,” she would
say, or, “There a blackbird lived, there a thrush.”</p>

<p>“And soon, when passing Villa Barbiondi,” he
added once, “a friend may say, ‘There Donna
Hera lived.’”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said; “I shall part from the dear old
nest, as the birds part from theirs.”</p>

<p>Where the road branched upward to the dairy
Don Riccardo and his sister were waiting. Together
the four made the ascent of the zigzag way,
passing under oaks that had clung to their brown
leaves through all the assaults of winter and
moving beneath the mournful green of the needle-pines.
They walked about the scrupulously clean,
well-ordered houses and yards of the Social Dairy,
where moral enlightenment and manual energy
worked in concert. It was one of the several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
hundred places, Mario told them, that the new,
industrial plan had brought into being. He explained
the genius of co-operation, and how in
this instance it brightened the lives of thousands
of poor farmers. Hera remarked the air of well-being
that pervaded the place&mdash;the neat apparel
of the men and women, the interest they showed
in their work, and the absence from their eyes of
the driven look she had observed in a factory
of Milan.</p>

<p>“How bright and fresh and&mdash;happy they are!”
she said to Mario.</p>

<p>“They are not overworked,” he explained.
“They have only themselves and their families
to provide for.”</p>

<p>“I see nothing unusual in that,” observed Donna
Beatrice.</p>

<p>“I mean,” Mario went on, “that there are no
ladies and gentlemen to be fed and clothed out of
the profits of their work. That makes it possible
for them to earn in seven hours a day enough for
their needs and a little to spare for the bank&mdash;the
bank that gives them an interest in the earnings
of their deposits.”</p>

<p>“Wonderful!” exclaimed Don Riccardo. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
don’t profess to understand it at all. But
tell me, Honourable, how it is possible that
you, the busiest man in Rome, can find time
from your Parliamentary work for&mdash;this sort of
thing?”</p>

<p>“I like the country,” Mario answered, “and
this is the part of my work that is recreation.”</p>

<p>Going back to Viadetta they rode beside the
pasture lands, where herds of cattle browsed. In
one field Mario pointed out a black heifer that was
frisking alone.</p>

<p>“That is the wayward youngster I started after
with my lariat the other day,” he said. “She
came back this morning. I am grateful to her,
Donna Hera. But for that dash for liberty I should
not be with you to-day.”</p>

<p>She could have told him that her gratitude ought
to be more than his, and yet was not so, for the
fate the river had offered now seemed kinder than
the one in store for her.</p>

<p>“I perceive that the heifer soon tired of her liberty,”
Donna Beatrice remarked, complacently.
“Do you not think, Signor Forza, it would be the
same with your common people? Give them what
they think they want, and quickly they will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
whining for what they had before and which was
better for them.”</p>

<p>“I suppose they would,” Mario assented,
smiling, “if the new condition left them hungry
and shelterless, as it did our heifer. She dreamed
of freedom, but woke to find that her two stomachs
were exceedingly real affairs. So she came home
and sold her freedom for a mess of pottage.”</p>

<p>“Precisely!” Donna Beatrice exclaimed, triumphantly.
“In the practical brute kingdom as
well as in the human world dreamers are likely
to come to grief.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” Mario agreed, “and yet the
dreamer’s airy product often becomes a reality.
The dream of yesterday is the architect’s plan of
to-day on which the builders will be at work
to-morrow. There was our great compatriot who
dreamed of having the people of Italy pull together
under some well-laid plan, and do away with the
necessity that drives so many to seek prosperity
in foreign lands. That man is dead, but part of his
vision lives in the Social Dairy. The farmers whose
lot has been bettered by this system of co-operation
are stout believers in that dream, you may be
sure.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>“In what way are the farmers benefited?”
Donna Beatrice asked, sceptically.</p>

<p>“They get a fair share of the profit of their toil.
They send their milk here, and by processes that
are moral as well as scientific it is turned first into
butter, then into coin of the realm.”</p>

<p>“But, Signor Forza,” Donna Beatrice protested,
“I call this establishment eminently practical.”</p>

<p>“Everyone does now. Nevertheless, it was no
more than a theory two years ago&mdash;as much a
dream then as the Employers’ Liability bill is
now.”</p>

<p>“Will you interpret this new dream, Honourable?”
Don Riccardo asked. “What is the Employers’
Liability bill?”</p>

<p>“A Parliamentary measure to oblige the employers
of men and women in dangerous work to
insure their lives; to take care of them, too, should
they meet with injury.”</p>

<p>“Then the industrial army,” said Don Riccardo,
“would fare better at the hands of the state
than the military.”</p>

<p>“And it ought to,” Mario returned. “Work is
the hope of the world, war is its despair.”</p>

<p>Don Riccardo, with a shake of the head, bespoke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
his doubt as to that idea, and his sister, looking
into the face of Hera, was alarmed anew to read
there a frank expression of sympathy with Forza’s
sentiment. Mario rode with them as far as the
gates of the villa, and at parting Hera gave him
her hand.</p>

<p>“The day will live in my memory,” he told her.</p>

<p>“And in mine,” she said. “Good-bye.”</p>

<p>Tarsis dined with the Barbiondi next day and
took them in an automobile to Milan for the opera.
Hera, by his side, spent much of the ten-mile
journey in reflections that gave her no peace.
Before meeting Mario Forza she had begun to
know the calm there is in accepted bitterness.
For the sake of others she had resolved to be patiently
unhappy. Now the future had a changed
outlook&mdash;had opened to a sudden gleam, as a
cloud opens to sheet lightning at sunset. The
sacrifice demanded of her seemed far greater than
it did a few days before, and she was conscious of
a growing doubt that her strength should prove
equal to it. There came a throb of resentment,
too, that what she had been calling duty should
interpret its law so remorselessly.</p>

<p>Not until after the meeting with Forza had the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
sense of renunciation, of impending loss, been of
a positive nature. She had felt only that the
future could hold no happiness for her; now she
was aware of a joy to be killed, of a destiny that
should deny what her soul was quickening with
desire to possess. It was as if happiness had come
back from the tomb and she dared not receive
it.</p>

<p>In the box at La Scala she looked on the stage
spectacle, but the eyes of her mind saw Mario
Forza, and she heard his voice above the music
of the drama. The knowledge that she cared for
him so brought no feeling of shame, but shame
assailed her when she looked upon the ring and
the man who had placed it on her hand. In the
gold circle and the clear stone she saw only the
badge of a hideous bargain.</p>

<p>They went to a restaurant where fashionable
Milan assembles after the opera. At a table apart
from the one where they seated themselves she
saw Mario Forza in the company of some men
known as leaders of Italy’s political thought; and
when Tarsis perceived that Hera had caught sight
of him he could not refrain from venting his
feelings. Without any leading up to the subject,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
he spoke contemptuously of the new ideas of
government in the air.</p>

<p>“I have no patience with them,” he said.
“They are no more than the wild flowering of
poetic oratory in Parliament.”</p>

<p>“And like all wild flowers, they soon will fade,”
chimed in Donna Beatrice.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless,” Tarsis went on, “these dreamers
are doing much harm. They clog the wheels of
Italy’s true progress.”</p>

<p>“Can nothing be done to put down these dangerous
men?” asked Donna Beatrice, in alarm.</p>

<p>“Oh, no. Parliament is a talking machine,
wound up for all time. There’s no stopping it.
These demagogues delude the masses by telling
them that labour is the parent of wealth.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if it isn’t?” mused Don Riccardo,
lighting a cigarette.</p>

<p>“Admitting it,” Tarsis retorted, “should the
parent try to strangle its offspring? That is
what these rainbow statesmen would do. They
proclaim capital a despoiler of labour, yet keep
their addled wits at work concocting schemes for
the despoiling of capital. Take, for example, the
Employers’ Liability bill&mdash;simply a device to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
plunder the employer under the cloak of law.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you fully!” exclaimed Donna
Beatrice. “I have heard of that iniquitous
measure.”</p>

<p>“But capital will not flinch,” pursued the man
of millions. “It has a mission to redeem Italy by
making her industriously great. On that mission
it will press forward in spite of the demagogues,
and bestow the blessing of employment on the
poor in spite of themselves.”</p>

<p>Don Riccardo yawned behind his coffee cup,
but his sister brought her hands together in show
of applause, and uttered a little “Bravo!” For
Hera, she gave no sign. When Tarsis was talking,
somewhat heavily, with his air of a rich man, his
small, keen eyes looking into hers now and then,
she wondered what her life would be with such a
companion; but when they were moving homeward
past the darkened shop windows of Corso
Vittorio Emanuele, out through the Venetian
Gate, and speeding in the moonlight of the open
country, her reflections took a different cast. Her
soul cried out to be free, and to the cry for freedom
came an answering call to revolt.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of the next day&mdash;the one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
before that set for the wedding&mdash;she had her horse
saddled, heedless of Donna Beatrice’s warning that
the skies foreboded a tempest. A few paces from
the villa gates she heard at her back the sound of
galloping hoofs, and presently Mario was riding
at her side.</p>

<p>“I crossed the river yesterday,” he said, “in
the hope that you would ride, but met&mdash;disappointment.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” she told him, simply, yet he
understood that she meant, “It must not be.”</p>

<p>“Frowning skies invite us at times,” he went
on, “and by that I made my hope in to-day.”</p>

<p>“Yesterday was beautiful&mdash;far better for a
ride,” she admitted, as if to tell him that he had
divined the truth.</p>

<p>For a while they rode in silence. They passed
the ruins of a monastery known of old as the
Embrace of the Calm Valley. It had been one of
the many religious settlements in the domain of
the Barbiondi in the days of their power.</p>

<p>“I went there yesterday,” he told her, “and
found a strange sympathy in its desolate picture.”</p>

<p>“To me it always has been dear,” Hera said.
“My mother loved the old place. Often we went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
there and gathered the wild roses and camellias
that grew in the cloister.”</p>

<p>For a mile or more they rode on, then started
homeward because of danger signals not to be
ignored. There were glimmers of far-away lightning,
and they caught the distant roll of thunder.
Suddenly a black curtain unfolded over the skies.</p>

<p>Before them was a long stretch of open road,
at the end of which, where the wood began, they
could see the dark shape of the monastery walls;
and towards this they were making, their horses
lifted to a quicker pace, when they heard an
ominous rattling in the upper air.</p>

<span class="smaller">A FACT OF LIFE</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> warning was a terribly familiar one to the
people of Lombardy. They knew it presaged one
of the severe storms of hail that plague the
region&mdash;visitations which the farmer folk dread
even more than the sprees of the river. Within
the space of ten minutes the growing crops of a
whole province had been devastated by one of
these onslaughts. The pellets of ice were so big
as to fell cattle and kill the herdsmen. Roof tiles
of terra cotta were smashed like thin glass. Of
such grave import were the bombardments that
official means had been devised to ward them off;
and now, while the keepers hurried their droves
to places of safety, the air was filled with a thunder
that did not come from the clouds. On the hilltops
and in the sloping fields cannon flashed and
roared. With pieces aimed at the blackness
above, the peasant gunners fired volley after
volley in a scientific endeavor to choke the hailstorm.
The picture, as they saw it from their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
windows, was one to carry old soldiers back to Solferino
and Magenta, when the target was not clouds,
but Austrians, and the missiles were shot and shell.</p>

<p>Mario and Hera set their horses to a gallop and
made for the cover of the monastery, as troopers
might have dashed across a battle-field. They
gained the crumbling portico at the moment that
the white bullets began to fall, crackling in the
ivy of the wall and dancing on the ground. A
few columns of the cloister were standing, and
some of the roof remained. Here they left their
horses to paw the pavement where monks had
walked in the ages long buried. He took her
hand and they made their way over a difficult
mound of earth and fallen stone to the chapel.
Once or twice in the centuries something had been
done to save the little church from time’s ravage,
though it stood open yet, as to door and window,
for the attacks of wind and weather. Rooks had
nested there, and the flutter of invisible wings
sounded from a dark corner beneath the ceiling.
She told him that the chapel was built by the first
Riccardo of her line. Standing by a window, they
looked out and saw the hailstones beating on the
tombs of her ancestors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>Hera pointed to a place on the wall where a
fresco painting once had been. Fragments of a
cornice carved in marble still clung about it; to
the eye there was only a patch of blank wall.</p>

<p>“It was the portrait of Arvida, a woman of
our race,” she said, regarding the spot and its
remnant of frame thoughtfully. “At one time
her tomb was here, under the picture.”</p>

<p>“And is in the chapel no longer?”</p>

<p>“No; they branded her a heretic and drove her
to her grave, as our chronicles say; and still not
satisfied, they disinterred her body and burned it
in Milan.”</p>

<p>“How strange it all seems in this day,” he
mused, “when one may think as he will about his
soul without putting his body in peril before or
after it has returned to the ground.”</p>

<p>“And yet,” she said, quickly, as if in an outburst
of feeling long restrained, “there is still a power
that persecutes&mdash;that takes the soul and enchains
the body.”</p>

<p>“The power you mean is duty,” he said,
positively, as one who understood.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she affirmed, eagerly, glad in the knowledge
that he read her thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>There was silence between them as they moved
to a part of the chapel where a broad window
looked out on the landscape of ploughed fields
that stretched high into the rainy distance. When
he spoke again it was in the tone of one who had
come to a decision.</p>

<p>“The world’s cruelest wrongs have been committed
in the name of duty,” he said. “Fortunately
for the happiness of the race, we have
cut loose from many ancient notions of obligation.
The zealots who persecuted Arvida acted from a
sense of duty. With new ideals of justice rise
new conceptions of what we owe to others.”</p>

<p>“How can we know what to do?” she asked of
him, humbly.</p>

<p>“Ah, it is hard to know what to do&mdash;to decide
what is right. But there is a path that we
may follow with safety at all times. It is the
path which keeps us true to ourselves. We have
a right to be true to ourselves!” he asserted,
warmly&mdash;“a right no man may deny.”</p>

<p>“And when one renounces that right for the
sake of others?” she asked. “What then?”</p>

<p>“That is the noblest of all self-sacrifices,” he
answered her, reverently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>But in her sudden release of a breath and the
drooping of her eyes he read, with the magic
sensitivity of love, that his answer was a disappointment;
that for the bread of censure the
woman asked he had given a stone of praise.
When he spoke again Hera, with quickening
pulse, knew the calm of his character was going;
and she was glad for the passion in his tone and
the anger that hardened his voice.</p>

<p>“The sacrifice is divine!” he exclaimed. “But
the demand for it, the permitting of it, that is
monstrous! No human interest can justify the
ruin of a life, the desecration of a soul!”</p>

<p>He drew closer to her, his studied control of the
past all gone.</p>

<p>“Donna Hera!” he cried, “this must not be&mdash;this
marriage to-morrow. It is hideous in the eye
of God and man.”</p>

<p>There was command in his words, and the
glow of a splendid hope filled her soul. But it
lived only a moment, assailed by the thought that
commiseration was all that he had for her.</p>

<p>“Well may you pity me,” she said, the doubt
that had risen bringing a dreary smile to her
lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>“Pity!” he exclaimed, taking her hand, fervidly.
“Ah, no! It is greater than that! I love you,
Hera. From the first it has been so&mdash;from the
very first. Knowing all and realising all, I have
loved you with the whole power of my being. I
will not silence the cry of this love, and you, too,
must listen.”</p>

<p>An alarming yet rapturous shudder went
through her frame, and she shrank from him.
With hands at his temples, he stood like one dizzy
from a blow.</p>

<p>“Are you sorry?” he asked, and she made him
no answer. “Oh, not that!” he pleaded. “Not
that!”</p>

<p>She saw her life of despair whirling away, and
a new life dawning, beautiful, glorious.</p>

<p>“Sorry?” she said at last, her breath going with
the words. “No; I am glad.” And he drew her
to him, bent his head above hers, and kissed
her lips.</p>

<p>The shower had ceased and the sky was clearing.
From rifts in the speeding clouds streams of sunshine
found their way to earth. A golden shaft
came in by the open clerestory and lingered upon
them. Two bluebirds talked blithely on a window<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
ledge. The rook and his mate came down from
their dark corner to fly out into the sparkling air.</p>

<p>Beholding the sunshine, Mario said: “See, the
glory of heaven falls upon this unison.”</p>

<p>They laughed together like careless children,
forgetting all but their new-found joy, and feared
no more.</p>

<p>“I was lost; I have found my way,” she
murmured.</p>

<p>“And the mariner sailing under sealed orders
has learned his destiny,” he said. “I dreaded the
hour that was to take you from me, dear, and
reason lost hope; but not so the heart. And now
you are my own, my own for ever.”</p>

<p>“Yes; they shall not part us now,” she said,
nestling to him.</p>

<p>“Hera, how often have I dreamed of finding you!”</p>

<p>“And I of finding you.”</p>

<p>“When, my darling?”</p>

<p>For answer he had her eyes turned upward,
timorously, fluttering under the depths of his,
and then downcast, while she whispered the
words, “Always, Mario, always.” Again their lips
were locked.</p>

<p>“Have I your permission to enter?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>The words rang grimly in the old temple, sending
their echo from wall to wall. Mario and Hera
knew the voice. They turned toward the door, a
low opening arched in the Gothic form, and saw
standing there a dark figure sharply defined against
the sunshine that flooded the cloister. It was the
figure of Antonio Tarsis. His posture was that of
one quite calm, his arms folded, on his lips an
evil smile. He surveyed the others with a mock
air of amusement; then, taking off his motoring
cap, he made a low bow, and advanced with a
broad affectation of humility.</p>

<p>“I thank you for permitting me to enter,” he
began, the hoarseness of his tone betraying the
anger that consumed him. “My apology is
offered&mdash;my apology, you understand&mdash;for breaking
up a love scene between the woman who is to
be my wife to-morrow and another man.”</p>

<p>He paused as if expectant of some word from
them, but they did not speak; nor did they stir
from the spot where they stood when first they
beheld him.</p>

<p>“I was passing at the time of the hailstorm,
and came in for shelter,” Tarsis continued, feigning
the tone of one who felt obliged to explain an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
intrusion. “I saw your horses out there, and
recognising one of them, I judged that Donna
Hera was near by. Uncertain of the other horse,
I jumped to the natural&mdash;possibly you will say
foolish&mdash;conclusion that it was her father’s.”</p>

<p>He paused again, and waited for one of the
others to speak, but both remained silent.</p>

<p>“I say this much in extenuation of the fact that
I began to look about in search of my friends,”
Tarsis went on, retaining his tone of apology.
“Otherwise it might appear that I was spying
upon my promised wife. I assure you that it
never occurred to me to set a watch upon you,
Donna Hera. At the door I saw you and&mdash;waited
until the scene should come to an end. I have
been waiting some time. I hope my conduct in
the somewhat trying situation meets with your
approval&mdash;yours, Donna Hera, and yours, <i>Honourable</i>
Forza?”</p>

<p>He gave the “Honourable” a long-drawn emphasis
on the first syllable, and the sound came
back in a blood-chilling echo from the glistening
damp walls.</p>

<p>Mario moved forward and looked him squarely
in the eye. “Signor Tarsis,” he began, his voice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
without a quaver, “I am sorry, helplessly sorry.
We are confronted with an invincible fact of life.
I love Donna Hera. She loves me. By every
natural law we belong to each other.”</p>

<p>A flush of anger overspread the face of Tarsis.
He returned a derisive laugh and put on his cap.</p>

<p>“Law of nature, eh!” he flung back. “Society
is not governed by laws of nature, and will not be
until your anarchistic wishes prevail!”</p>

<p>“Do you mean,” Mario asked, retaining his self-control,
“that after what you have seen and what
I have told you it is still your intention to hold
Donna Hera to her engagement?”</p>

<p>“I will not answer your question,” Tarsis replied,
snapping his upturned fingers at Mario in the
Southern manner. “Whatever my intention may
be is not your affair. It is a subject for myself
and my promised wife. Of course, you will have
some theory about what I ought to do,” he added,
his lip curving to the sneer.</p>

<p>Humanly sensible that the other’s provocation
was great, Mario quelled the words of resentment
that came to his tongue, and said, calmly: “There
is no question of theory here. It is a fact
inexorable.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>“And one, I suppose, in which I am not to be
reckoned with,” Tarsis retorted, his mouth twitching
and his thick neck red with the mounting
blood. “You plot to rob me of the woman who is
pledged to me&mdash;you do me the greatest wrong
one man can do another&mdash;and you call it a fact
inexorable. Bah! I know your breed! My
factories are full of fellows like you!”</p>

<p>Hera laid a restraining hand on Mario’s arm,
saying, “Bear it, we have given him cause,” and
in that instant the enormity of the situation their
love had produced came fully to their minds. It
was a realisation that made Hera recoil in dread
of the consequences; but Mario, convinced of the
larger justice in the course they had taken, advanced
a step toward Tarsis and said&mdash;all regret,
all suggestion of considerateness gone from his
manner:</p>

<p>“When you say that I plotted to rob you of her
you speak falsely. There was no plot, no premeditated
act. Donna Hera is wholly without
blame. My love for her began in the moment of
our first meeting. It bore me on irresistibly,
despite the hopelessness of it ever present to my
thought. Had she loved you I should never have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
spoken. I knew she did not love you; I knew she
was going to a life of thraldom, to be a hostage
to the fortune of others. Understand, I do not
tell you this in a spirit of excuse, but only for
the purpose of acquainting you with the facts. I
do not try to make excuse to you; I do not seek
self-justification.”</p>

<p>Tarsis laughed at him scornfully. “Oh, <i>bravissimo</i>!”
he sneered. “You do not see any wrong
in making love to the woman who is to be my
wife!”</p>

<p>“She is not to be your wife,” Mario said. “You
must know that Donna Hera cannot be your wife
now.”</p>

<p>Tarsis was at the point of another outburst of
wrath, but checked himself as if with a purpose
suddenly conceived. He riveted his gaze first
upon Hera, then upon the other, and stood silent,
with knitted brows, the subtlest forces of his
nature waked by Mario’s last words. These words
warned him that from his grasp was slipping the
prize he valued above any on which he had ever
set his powerful will. He moved off from them
and paced slowly to and fro, with bowed head.
The sound of his footfalls was all that broke the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
stillness of the chapel. Once or twice he looked
up, toward Mario and Hera, and they saw the
despair written in his strong face. They were
stirred to a feeling of pity, of guilt, as they contemplated
what seemed to them their work. A
little while, and he paused, drew near to Hera,
and said to her, his voice that of a man crushed
in spirit:</p>

<p>“Is it true? Has he prevailed upon you to
break off our marriage?”</p>

<p>Pale and resolute, she answered: “No; he has
not prevailed upon me. It is my choice&mdash;the
only way.”</p>

<p>Tarsis made a show of submission by twice inclining
his head. “I suppose you are right,” he
said, as if resigned. “Of your purpose in engaging
yourself to me I was aware, but I hoped in time
to win your affection. It is the hand of fate.”</p>

<p>Hera’s eyes were moistening. “I am to blame,”
she said, contritely. “It was wrong of me to
consent to a marriage with you; but I was driven,
oh, I was driven. Forgive me, I beg of you.”</p>

<p>Tarsis looked into her eyes and extended his
hand, as the act of one who in the stress of his
emotion was unable to speak. “There is a request<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
I would make,” he said. “It is that you help me
to come out of this in as good a light as possible
before the world. Help to mitigate the disgrace
it puts upon me. If the marriage could be postponed,
not definitely broken off; at least, if the
world could be told so at first&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I will do as you wish,” Hera assured him,
willingly.</p>

<p>“I thank you, sincerely. Will you return with
me to the villa, that we may make some arrangement
while there is yet time?”</p>

<p>“Yes; let us go.”</p>

<p>She bade Mario adieu and started for the door
with Tarsis. They had gone only a few paces when
they heard the voice of Mario. “A word, Donna
Hera, if you will be good enough to wait,” he said.</p>

<p>Tarsis wheeled quickly, with flashing eye, and
the others saw that once more he was his aggressive
self; but this time, as before, he checked the impulse
to pour forth his anger on Mario, remembering
that he had more important work to do. He
bowed his head and drooped his shoulders, as
became a crushed spirit, and waited, ears alert.</p>

<p>“Hera,” Mario said, when they stood a little
apart from Tarsis, “I wish to tell you that I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
summoned to Rome to-night. I meant to leave
Viadetta on the train that meets the Roman express
at Milan. If you need me I will not go. If
you have the slightest misgiving, the faintest
sense that you want me at your side, I will go
with you now to Villa Barbiondi.”</p>

<p>The fists of Tarsis doubled and relaxed and his
eyes were sidelong as he watched her face and
listened. The smile of the cheat who takes a trick
came to his lips when he caught her answer.</p>

<p>“It will be kinder if you are absent,” she said&mdash;“kinder
to him. It is all that we can do,” and she
added, trustfully, “I have no misgiving.”</p>

<p>With a soft word of farewell, she turned from
him and walked with Tarsis to the cloister, where
their horses stood. From his place in the chapel
Mario saw Tarsis help her to mount and follow her
through the broken portico. Then the masonry hid
them from his view, and the next minute the noise
of an automobile told him they were on the road.</p>

<p>“God Almighty bless and keep you, Hera!” he
murmured. In the chapel he lingered, looking
upon the flaming west and darkening hillside,
until his lonely horse called to him with impatient
neighs.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE SCALES OF HONOUR</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> Mario and Hera were taken in by the
counterfeit despair and make-believe submission
of Tarsis proved how little they knew the man
with whom they had to deal. Tarsis had as much
thought of giving up Hera as he had of parting
with his life. In the last words spoken to him by
Mario&mdash;“She is not to be your wife”&mdash;he knew
that he had heard the declaration of a resolute
strike against his fondest design; and to set about
breaking it by means of craft instead of open
resistance was only the instinctive recourse of a
character schooled in devices. The art of throwing
the antagonist off his guard had become a second
nature with him. Always this was the first move
he made in a fight with his fellow-man. He had
achieved his earlier successes in the business world
by causing powerful rivals to despise him&mdash;to
regard him as a factor not worth reckoning with.
He had won victories by feigning acceptance of
defeat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>He hated failure as a shark hates the land. All
over Italy the wedding day had been heralded,
and he was determined that the marriage should
take place. Labour unions with which he had to do
knew something of his granite will when set to the
breaking of a strike. While he moved toward the
villa, holding the motor car to the pace of Hera’s
horse, he had time to think out the details of his
plan.</p>

<p>Arrived at the villa, a maid informed Hera
that Donna Beatrice was absent in Milan. As to
Don Riccardo, the serving woman said, <i>Gh’e
minga</i>, which is the Lombardian equivalent for
“not about” or “missing.” He had set out on
horseback in the direction of Lodi a half-hour
before. Sadly Hera reflected that with her father,
whom she loved for his endearing frailties, it had
always been <i>G’he minga</i>. She knew his soul
rebelled against the alliance with Tarsis, but that
he lacked the strength to put away the cup of ease
it held to his lips. She had hoped that he would
be at hand now, as one at least in the household to
rejoice at the course she had chosen. She noted
that the news of their being alone brought a gleam
of satisfaction to the eyes of Tarsis. When they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
entered the reception hall the old sternness had
settled on his countenance, replacing the broken-spirited
humility that had moved her so deeply
in the chapel.</p>

<p>“I hope it will not be presuming on your
favour,” were his opening words, “if I ask you
for light on one or two points?”</p>

<p>“No,” she answered. “It is your right. I wish
to be frank&mdash;to tell you all.”</p>

<p>“How long have you been under the influence
of this man?”</p>

<p>“The question is unfair to him and to me,” she
said. “I will answer any question that you
have a right to ask, but I will not quarrel with
you.”</p>

<p>Tarsis rose from where he was seated, walked
the width of the room and back, and when he
spoke again his manner was milder.</p>

<p>“How long have you known him?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“We met last week for the first time. It was
on the day the bridge broke.”</p>

<p>“Do you think it just to me that you have kept
the affair secret?”</p>

<p>“Not until this hour have we spoken of our
love.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>“But all the time you were plotting my disgrace,”
he argued, eyeing her shrewdly.</p>

<p>“There was no plot,” she averred, rising, impatiently.
“If you cannot be fair discussion is
useless.”</p>

<p>“Be fair!” he flung out, drawing nearer to her.
“Let me ask if you think it fair to discard me at
this hour&mdash;to degrade me before the world?”</p>

<p>Without hesitation she answered: “I was on
the point of doing you a great injury. My love
for Mario Forza has saved me.”</p>

<p>“Saved you from the crime of marrying me?”
he suggested, querulously.</p>

<p>“Say, rather, the crime of marriage with a man
I do not love,” she corrected.</p>

<p>“As you will; but I cannot see how it has saved
you,” he told her, coolly.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Merely that engagements of marriage are
contracts, and not to be treated so lightly as you
and your&mdash;friend seem to think. I hold you to
your promise.”</p>

<p>“In the chapel you said&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” he broke in, with a shrug. “I
accepted the situation, but it was only pretence.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
I did not feel called upon to discuss the subject
then and there. The fact is, Donna Hera, the
marriage must take place to-morrow, just as it
has been arranged.”</p>

<p>“No, no!” she exclaimed, a note of entreaty in
her voice. “You must release me.”</p>

<p>“I will not release you!” he declared, calmly,
relentlessly. “You will become my wife to-morrow
in the cathedral of Milan. And do you know why?
Because the honour of a Barbiondi will hold you
to the right.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I cannot!” she cried, and moved from
him, but he followed.</p>

<p>“I am sure that you will,” he persisted. “I am
sure that your better self will guide you when you
pause to think.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it is impossible!” was all she could answer.</p>

<p>“It was not so impossible a few days ago,” he
reminded her, cynically.</p>

<p>“I know, I know,” she owned, helplessly,
looking into his hard face. “If you were a woman
you would understand why it is different now.”</p>

<p>“I think I understand you,” he pursued. “For
the moment you are governed by notions of right
and wrong that are not yours, that are unworthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
of you. You are swayed alone by a desire for your
own happiness. In the end you will look with
less selfish eyes and see where your duty is.”</p>

<p>To her mind rose the assertion of Mario that
from a sense of duty great wrongs might spring,
and she knew the force of it now, with her promised
husband demanding the sacrifice of her love,
and conscience whispering that his demand was
just. Tarsis smiled in content to perceive that he
had brought her to a troubled state of mind.</p>

<p>“I am convinced,” he went on, “that you do
not realise the extent of the cruelty, the wickedness
of the act you contemplate. You can not be
aware of the severity of the blow you would deal
me. I have bought the old Barbiondi palace in
Milan, and men are at work preparing it for our
occupancy. I have the promise of the King to
dine with us on our return from abroad. All Italy
awaits&mdash;but enough. You need not be told the
details. To consummate the deed you have undertaken
would be infamous. For me it means a
disaster that time could not repair, and for you&mdash;you
would reproach yourself for ever; it would
haunt you all your days, and be a curse to you.
But you will not do it, Donna Hera. Ah, no; you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
will not. Nor would Mario Forza have asked it
of you had he paused to see the terrible injustice
to me. I say he would not, provided, of course,
he is the high-souled gentleman you believe him
to be. Could he see the wrong in the magnitude
that you see it now, I am sure that he as well as
I would beg you to desist&mdash;to stand true to your
promise.”</p>

<p>It was not by chance that Tarsis brought the
name of Mario into his plea, and in the effect he
perceived it had on Hera he knew he had reckoned
well. She stood with her back to him now, a hand
pressed to each temple.</p>

<p>“So confident am I that Signor Forza would
do me justice,” Tarsis continued, “that I beg you
in the name of your honour to appeal to him, to
send for him at once and put my fate in his hands.
I pledge myself to abide by what he says.”</p>

<p>Slowly she moved away and sank into a
chair, preoccupied with the thought he had
suggested.</p>

<p>“I will do as you wish,” she said, presently, confident
that Mario would hold her to the path their
love had chosen. “But that is impossible,” she
added, after a glance at the clock. “He said he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
would leave Viadetta in time to join the Roman
express at Milan.”</p>

<p>“Signor Forza goes to Rome to-night?” the
other asked, in astonishment that was spurious,
for he had heard all that Mario said to her at the
parting in the chapel.</p>

<p>“Yes; and it is too late to reach him,” she replied,
precisely as Tarsis had expected.</p>

<p>“Signor Forza’s departure for Rome,” he
hastened to tell her, “does not present any serious
difficulty in the way of communicating with him,
if it is still your wish to pursue that course.”</p>

<p>“It is my wish; of that you may be assured,”
she said, positively, in the full belief that there
could be only one decision by Mario Forza. “How
can I communicate with him?”</p>

<p>“By making use of the telegraph. A message
to Rome, delivered in the railway station at the
instant of his arrival, if answered at once, would
make it possible for you to have his advice by
midnight.”</p>

<p>“Ahem!”</p>

<p>It was Donna Beatrice. She had paused on the
threshold, and stood looking from one to the other,
puzzled by the serious aspect of the scene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, how do you do, Signor Tarsis?” she said,
breezily, going forward to take his hand. “I
have come from Milan. The finishing touch has
been given to the arrangements. All is in readiness.
They say there has been a terrible hailstorm.
Hera, my dear, I warned you a storm was brewing.
I hope you were not caught in it, and you, Signor
Tarsis?”</p>

<p>He answered that they both had been overtaken
and both had found shelter in the monastery.</p>

<p>“Indeed! How interesting!” Donna Beatrice
exclaimed. “A most romantic coincidence, upon
my word!”</p>

<p>Neither of the others joined to her tittering the
shadow of a smile, but Donna Beatrice was not
surprised, for she had guessed that some grave
disturbance of the peace had occurred. She
shivered at the thought that the great consummation
booked for to-morrow might be in jeopardy.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Signor Tarsis,” she chirped,
“but I am going to ask Hera to come with me for
a little while&mdash;just a moment before dinner. You
will not mind, I am sure. It is&mdash;let us say&mdash;the
last pre-nuptial secret. After to-day no more
secrets.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>Her small laugh sounded again, and slipping
her arm within Hera’s she drew her toward the
door. Hera held back a little as they passed
Tarsis, and, to the elder woman’s deeper mystification,
said to him, softly:</p>

<p>“I will write the telegram.”</p>

<p>Tarsis returned a low bow, saying, “At your
pleasure.”</p>

<p>They ascended to Donna Beatrice’s apartments.
“Hera, I am positive that something dreadful has
happened!” the aunt announced, when they were
alone.</p>

<p>“Something dreadful was about to happen,”
Hera explained, “but I have averted it.”</p>

<p>“I beseech you,” cried Donna Beatrice, “not to
speak in riddles. In the name of heaven, what
have you done?”</p>

<p>“I have told Signor Tarsis that I cannot be his
wife.”</p>

<span class="smaller">A CENSORED DESPATCH</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> expectant of some shocking disclosure,
and nerved for it, Donna Beatrice was not equal
to an utter smash-up of all that she had planned
and executed so satisfactorily to herself.</p>

<p>“Mario Forza!” she shrieked when the power
to articulate was hers once more. “Oh, I knew it
would be! From the first I saw the danger! We
are ruined! To-morrow they will be here with their
bills, a pack of hungry wolves. Hera! Wicked,
heartless, cruel! Have you no mercy for me, for
your father?”</p>

<p>In her violent agitation of mind, only half
conscious of her words and acts, she moved into
the corridor, beating her temples and wailing.</p>

<p>“Riccardo! Oh, my brother, where are you in
this most terrible of moments?” she cried out with
all the voice she could muster. “Calamity has
befallen us! Search for him, everybody. Search
for Don Riccardo!”</p>

<p>It was an outburst that startled the domestics<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
above and below stairs, and carried ominously to
the Duke himself, who had just entered the house
and was about to greet Tarsis in the reception
hall. Guessing that the trouble concerned his
appointed son-in-law, he turned away from him,
dreading an appeal for assistance. To his sister’s
resonant signals of distress, however, he started
to respond, but with more deliberation than
eagerness. He could not have made his way up
the staircase with less haste if the wonted calm of
the villa had been undisturbed. Instinctively he
paused in the ante-chamber of Donna Beatrice’s
apartments, hesitating to become a part of the
catastrophe, whatever it might be.</p>

<p>“What is the meaning of this awful affair?”
he heard his sister ask of Hera.</p>

<p>“It means that my love is for Mario Forza. To
be the wife of another is impossible unless he bids
me do so.”</p>

<p>“Unless who bids you do so?” Donna Beatrice
gasped.</p>

<p>“Mario Forza.”</p>

<p>“Heaven and the saints!” exclaimed the elder
woman. “What new madness is this? And when
do you expect to have his permission?” she asked,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
with all the sarcasm she could summon to the words.</p>

<p>“Signor Tarsis says we may have his answer by
midnight.”</p>

<p>“Signor Tarsis! Oh, spare me these mysteries!”</p>

<p>“At the request of Signor Tarsis,” Hera explained,
“I shall send a telegram to Signor Forza,
who is on the way to Rome. In the message I
shall ask him what to do.”</p>

<p>“And your promised husband?” said Donna
Beatrice. “Is he by chance to be consulted&mdash;to
have a voice in the matter?”</p>

<p>“He has agreed to abide by what Signor Forza
says,” Hera answered.</p>

<p>“Agreed to abide! Monstrous! Perfectly monstrous!
Abide, indeed! Will you be good enough
to tell me what alternative he has when you are
capable of breaking your promise in this conscienceless
manner? But it is not you. The
daughter of my brother, a Barbiondi, could not
commit this crime of her will. It is the man under
whose dreadful influence she has fallen.”</p>

<p>“Dear aunt,” Hera pleaded, going up to her,
“try to calm yourself. There has been no influence.
Believe me, I do but obey the prompting
of my heart.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>“Prompting of the heart!” the other repeated,
vixenishly. “That is a luxury we cannot afford.
Oh, where is your father?”</p>

<p>She rang for a servant, and unconsciously
sounded as well the signal for Don Riccardo to
withdraw from the ante-room. The Duke was
well content with the step Hera had taken. It
was the one he had longed to advise since the night
of Mario’s visit in the villa, but always he had
lacked the courage. Like Hera, he felt confident
that Mario, his love alone inspiring the answer to
the telegram, would tell her to be true to the call
of her soul; and he had no misgiving for the outcome
of his daughter’s adventure.</p>

<p>So he went for a stroll in the villa park, taking
care to walk where no servant sent by his sister
should be likely to find him. That poor lady was
in the last despair when Hera left the room to go
to her own apartments to write the message. She
assigned a footman to hunt for Don Riccardo, and
although the man did his best he brought back
only the customary <i>G’he minga</i>. A little while
and Hera, the message in hand, was in the reception
hall, where Tarsis waited alone.</p>

<p>“This is what I have written,” she said. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
cast his eye quickly over the lines at first, reread
them slowly, and folding the sheet nodded his
head in approval.</p>

<p>“You have put the case fairly,” he said, returning
the paper to her hands. “It is most gracious
of you.” And then, as if in sudden memory of an
appointment, he added: “I must set off for
Milan. Will you make my compliments to your
aunt, and say that I am unable to stay for dinner?
A meeting of directors to-night calls me to the city.
By midnight I shall be back&mdash;for his answer, and
yours. <i>Au revoir.</i>”</p>

<p>He held out his hand, and when she had taken
it he started for the door. At the threshold he
paused, turned about, and said, approaching her
again: “We pass the post-office in Castel-Minore,
where there is a telegraph bureau. If you wish it
I will carry the message there. Thus we shall save
time. In five minutes, with my car, we shall
be in Castel-Minore. You will appreciate that
it is of importance the telegram be sent at
once.”</p>

<p>Without the slightest hesitation she handed him
the message.</p>

<p>“I will arrange with them to bring you the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
answer as soon as it is received,” he said, and left
the house.</p>

<p>Once beyond the park gates and moving along
the Adda bank, he crushed the paper in his fist
and thrust it into a coat pocket. It had no place
in the plan he began to lay. Every detail of the
scheme stood definitely in his mind by the time
he told Sandro, the driver, to stop before the
post-office. He entered the telegraph bureau, but
the message he wrote and gave to the operator
was not the one written by Donna Hera; yet it
was addressed precisely as hers had been&mdash;“To
the Station Master at Rome, for Hon. Mario
Forza, to arrive by Roman express.” He had
scribbled the words, “All is well,” and signed
them “H.”</p>

<p>“Milan,” he said to Sandro, as he entered the
automobile, “and at the top speed.”</p>

<p>The false telegram was intended only to keep
his trail clear&mdash;to put his undertaking beyond
risk of failure through mischance. If Hera by
hazard inquired she would learn that a telegram
had been sent to Mario Forza. Tarsis had no fear
that she might carry the inquiry further, at least
until after it would be too late to alter an accomplished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
fact&mdash;the fact of their wedding. Tarsis’s
next need was a telephone. He could have found
one in Castel-Minore, but provincial “centrals”
have wide ears and long tongues, so he put off the
most important part of the undertaking until he
should reach the big town.</p>

<p>It was a run of eight miles in the moonlight,
and in a few minutes they were at the Venetian
Gate with the Dogana guards asking Tarsis if he
had any dutiable goods. Their pace was not
diminished much when they were under way again
on the pavement of the Corso. There was a man
in Rome whom Tarsis wanted to catch on the
wire before he should leave his home for the opera,
and time was valuable. Pedestrians cursed Sandro
as he flew by with tooting horn. At Via
Monte Napoleone, where they left the Corso, Tarsis
smiled as he thought of the mythical directors’
meeting he told Hera he had to attend. Another
minute and he was entering the door of his private
offices in Piazza Pellico. All the clerks had gone
to their homes, and no one but the old porter saw
him enter the building. With a key he let
himself into that part of the suite where his
exclusive apartment was, and went at once to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
his desk and took up the receiver of a telephone.</p>

<p>“Put me in communication with 16 A, Quirinale,
Rome,” he said. In the wait that followed he
drew from his pocket the writing of Hera, spread
out the crumpled paper, and to make sure that his
plan should fit in with the words she had written,
he read again the message intended for Mario
Forza:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“He would hold me to engagement. I have
told him it cannot be. He maintains that if
guided by justice I must keep my word, and asks
me to appeal to you. He is willing to abide by
your decision. Answer at once.</p>

<p class="right">“H.”</p></div>

<p>He smiled to think how well Hera had played
into his hands in the wording of the message&mdash;how
easy she had made it for him to give practical
form to his project of withholding it from Mario
and arranging with a confederate in Rome to
send an answer supposably from Mario that should
counsel Hera to stand by her engagement of
marriage. About the day of reckoning, when
his treachery should be disclosed, Tarsis was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
the sort of man to worry. Time enough, he
told himself to meet that difficulty when it appeared.
In this moment, his crowning ambition
at stake, every consideration of life dwindled
to nothingness before that of making certain
of performance the ceremony appointed for the
following day. The telephone bell jingled.</p>

<p>“This is Rome?” he asked, the receiver at ear.
“Quirinale, 16 A? And it is you, Signor Ulrich?
Is there any one within sound of your voice?
Your voice, I say. Is there any one in the room
with you? Alone? Good. This is Signor Tarsis.
I have a commission of great moment. You will
pay strict attention to what I say, and if you have
the slightest doubt that you hear aright do not
hesitate to stop me, and I will repeat. You will
go to the Central Railway station to-night, and
await the arrival of the Roman express from the
north. One of its passengers is Mario Forza.
Forza. F-o-r-z-a. Yes; of the Chamber of Deputies.
You know him by sight? Very good. As
soon as he has left the station you will send by telegraph
the message that I now will dictate. You
will write it down. Are you ready?</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“‘To Donna Hera dei Barbiondi, Castel-Minore,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
Brianza. Justice gives him first claim. Let justice
be your guide. M.’</p></div>

<p>“You have that? Read it slowly. Good.
You will put that message on the wire as soon as
Mario Forza has left the station. Now, repeat my
instructions from the beginning. All right. One
thing more. When you have sent the message
call me up. Yes; I am in Milan. I shall await
your call in Piazza Pellico. That is all. Addio.”</p>

<p>Signor Ulrich was the only man in Italy to
whom Tarsis would have intrusted the errand&mdash;Ulrich
the Austrian, as he was known to the
toilers; superintendent of all the Tarsis silk works.
As a crusher of labor revolts he had proved himself
a master, and Tarsis, perceiving a sound investment
of capital, had made him rich while making
him loyal. He knew that the little device of the
telegram would remain as deep a secret as if it
were known to himself alone.</p>

<p>“You may go and return at 11:30,” he said to
Sandro, at the door, and the hungry driver sent his
machine forward like an arrow. On the way to
Café Cova for dinner Tarsis reflected complacently
that the particulars of his scheme had been well
executed. He had no concern, therefore, as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
the outcome. Take care of the details and the
generalities will take care of themselves, was a
business adage of his own making that he had
followed, to the consternation many a time of his
larger-visioned rivals.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smaller">A MESSAGE FROM ROME</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Don Riccardo</span>, from his secluded ground in the
villa park, saw Tarsis’s car pass in the twilight,
and guessed that the message to Rome was on its
way. He thought the moment a good one, therefore,
to take shelter indoors from the dewy air.
Hera greeted him with a more cheerful countenance
than he had seen her wear for many days,
although she had made a brave effort to conceal
her feelings. She told him what he already knew
from the dialogue he had overheard a half-hour
before. He made no concealment of his delight
that Tarsis, after all, was not to be his son-in-law.
Knowing that the blow was a heavy one for his
sister, he went to her apartments to console her
with some news he had heard that afternoon from
his old friend Colonel Rosario, whose regiment of
infantry was stationed at Castel-Minore. Over
cognac and cigars in his quarters the commandant
told Don Riccardo that Mario Forza, having
inherited the large estate of his father, the Duke of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
Montenevica, was far from being a poor man&mdash;as
yet.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that ‘as yet’?” Don
Riccardo had asked.</p>

<p>“It expresses the state of mind of certain of his
heirs expectant,” the Colonel explained. “You
see, Forza has contracted the helping habit&mdash;spends
money for the good of others. His dreams
for the betterment of the under dog are expensive,
and his poor relations are alarmed lest he come
to want.”</p>

<p>Don Riccardo suppressed the rumor of future
destitution, and told Beatrice only enough to show
her that the exchange of bridegrooms need not be
attended by financial disaster. He found his
sister down with a headache, and as for consoling
her, try as he would, that was impossible with the
hateful name of Mario Forza on his lips. The
mere pronouncing of it caused her face to wrinkle
in an expression of deep contempt.</p>

<p>“Oh, Riccardo!” she wailed. “Do you not
feel the shame of it? Our house will be disgraced
forever!”</p>

<p>“Not forever, dear Beatrice,” he said in an effort
to comfort. “It will give the gossips a nine-day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
wonder, and then we shall hear of it no more.
Better a nine-day wonder than a lifetime of
regret.”</p>

<p>“Regret?” she asked in genuine amazement.
“For whom?”</p>

<p>“For all of us, my sister. With Tarsis Hera’s
life could be no other than one of misery. In the
end you will be glad that matters have taken this
turn. Of that I am sure.” But the other only
shook her head and dried her eyes.</p>

<p>The dinner was not such a gloomy affair as it
had promised to be, although only three of the
company of five expected were present&mdash;the Duke,
Hera, and Colonel Rosario. The hearty old soldier
marvelled at the absence of the bridegroom-elect,
but Don Riccardo asked him how Tarsis could
go on being the richest man in Italy if he did
not put business before dinner. It was an explanation
that did not satisfy the Colonel, but he accepted
it with a laugh and the comment, “Italy is
no longer a country; it is a machine for making
money.” Donna Beatrice had sent word that she
would have a bowl of broth above stairs. It was
well for her feelings she was not there to witness
the good spirits that prevailed at the board. Don<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
Riccardo called for one of the precious bottles of
Lacrimae Christi put in the cellar by his grandfather.
The Colonel gave the toast “To the
wedding to-morrow,” but the Duke secretly drank
to Hera’s narrow escape.</p>

<p>The dinner ended, and the Colonel gone to his barracks,
Hera, alone with her father in a corner of the
reception hall where the piano stood, ran over, in
a resurge of sweet memory, the ballad of the vintage
Mario gave that night. She remembered it
all, and sang as one whose soul overflowed with
joy. For hours, awaiting the answer from Rome&mdash;the
answer their hearts had already given&mdash;they
sat together in the great old room, where
portraits, one above the other, dimmed by time,
covered the walls. The wings of the broad, mullioned
casements, beneath their transoms of
stained glass, stood ajar to the breath of spring,
and the mysterious night lispings of the new-born
season toned the silence at times, foretelling long
sunny days, roses, and music in the woods.</p>

<p>Hera was first to hear the clatter of hoofs, and
she rose, keen for the tidings. A footman entered
with a message from the Castel-Minore bureau
of telegraphs. She held it under a light, read it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
first with puzzled countenance, and again with
clearer, too certain understanding. Her father
saw her catch her breath and press a hand to her
side.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he asked, and she handed him
the message.</p>

<p>“Justice gives him first claim,” he read. “Let
justice be your guide.”</p>

<p>He asked her what it meant, but she stood as
one turned to stone.</p>

<p>“God!” exclaimed Don Riccardo. “He gives
you up&mdash;puts justice before love! That is the
meaning. Bah! Then you are well rid of him,
my daughter. The bloodless reasoner! Ah, lovers
did not so in my day. Indeed it is an age of
machine-made men.”</p>

<p>For Hera it was a withering disappointment.
Hers was no romantic schoolgirl’s attachment,
but the full-powered, storm-surviving passion of a
woman of twenty-four&mdash;a passion heeding no call
before that of itself. And fondly she had dreamed
that with Mario it was the same. But the message
told her&mdash;what a different story! He confessed
a love stronger, higher than that which he
bore for her&mdash;the love of justice, a lifeless abstraction.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
Suddenly he became little in her eyes, and
she recoiled from the chill of such a nature. Here
then was the desolate ending of the sweet poem
life had begun to read for her; the shattering of a
beautiful faith, the farewell to an ideal that had
budded in girlhood and blossomed with woman’s
estate.</p>

<p>The sound of an affected cough startled her and
Don Riccardo from their gloomy reflections.
They looked up and beheld Tarsis at the threshold,
but they were not in time to see the contented
smile of comprehension that had curved his
lip.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” he said, moving toward
them. “The outer door was open, and I took the
liberty of entering unannounced. I did not know
you were here.”</p>

<p>Hera arose and walked to where her father
stood surveying Tarsis with eyes that betrayed an
emotion of anger strange indeed to the happy-go-lucky
Duke. She asked him for the telegram, and
absently he placed it in her hand.</p>

<p>“It is better, I think, that you leave us for the
present,” she said, in a low voice.</p>

<p>“What shall you do?” Don Riccardo asked,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
his impulse to intercede going the way it had gone
often before.</p>

<p>“That which honor commands,” she answered,
coldly, desperately. So Don Riccardo, torn by
warring impulses, but unable to be more than
nature had ordained, made off slowly, to wait in
the library, with a glass at his elbow and a cigar
in his lips.</p>

<p>“The answer from Rome has arrived,” Hera
said, and gave Tarsis the message.</p>

<p>Without betrayal of his eagerness to know that
his scheme had not miscarried, he began to read
it. “I was sure Signor Forza’s sense of justice
would prevail,” he said, looking up from the paper,
not the faintest note of triumph in his tone.
“Believe me, Hera, it is better so&mdash;better for you
as well as me. You will be glad that he did not
counsel you to do me a wrong. I honor him
greatly.”</p>

<p>It needed no words from her to tell him that
his appreciation of such heroism was not
shared by the woman whom it sacrificed&mdash;a
fact he had counted upon to make his victory
certain.</p>

<p>“Oh, it is impossible,” Hera exclaimed, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
one yielding to an unconquerable aversion.
“Heaven help me! I cannot!”</p>

<p>Tarsis perceived that his victory was yet to be
won. He drew nearer to her, and stood by the
table on which she leaned, head in hands.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“I cannot, oh, I cannot,” was all she could
answer.</p>

<p>“Do you mean that you would break your last
promise as well as the first?” he asked, aggressively.</p>

<p>“My last promise?” she repeated, as if bewildered
in mind.</p>

<p>“Yes. You gave me your word that you would
accept Signor Forza’s decision. He has pointed
to you the right way. All the world will say as
much. Honor leaves you but one course. Unless
you persist wickedly, recklessly, in following your
own desire, putting from you every consideration
of right or wrong, spurning justice, moral obligation,
and the wishes of all save yourself&mdash;unless
you do all this, you will keep your promise.”</p>

<p>The facts were driving Hera overhard. Her
eyelids burned, but she kept back the tears that
wanted to flow. When she turned to Tarsis she
felt more like a supplicant for mercy than one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
asserting a right which a few hours earlier had
seemed not to be gainsaid&mdash;the right to be happy
in her love. With the solemnity of a woman
laying bare the most intimate secrets of her soul,
she told him that all her being revolted against
surrendering herself without affection merely
because of the concurrence that marriage implied;
it seemed a bestowal of authority to destroy her
spiritual existence.</p>

<p>“Having this sentiment,” Tarsis asked, “why
did you promise yourself to me?”</p>

<p>“It is true,” she answered, “that in the interest
of others I consented to become your wife; but
that was before I knew the meaning of love.”</p>

<p>Frankly she told him that the thought of the
union he wished was hideous in her sight; it would
be a sacrilege, the defilement of a sacred emotion
and her nature rebelled in a degree that was beyond
her control.</p>

<p>“Sincerely I wish to do all that honor requires,”
she said, humbly, “but to live in such a state I
cannot, come what may.”</p>

<p>Tarsis comprehended fully the difficulty as it
now presented itself, and he was equal to it. An
effectual method of his in business was to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
it easy for the other party to yield to his interest.
It mattered little to him on what terms she
accepted him as her husband. He would have
given the greater part of his fortune to assure the
performance of the ceremony which the world
awaited at noon.</p>

<p>“There is an alternative,” he said, solemnly,
“that would satisfy the obligation honor puts
upon you and at the same time leave inviolate the
sentiment you have just expressed.”</p>

<p>“An alternative?” she repeated, wondering.</p>

<p>“Yes. I will be satisfied if you become my
wife only in name&mdash;in the eyes of society, the
Church, and the civil law.”</p>

<p>Hera understood as she had not until then how
desperate was the strait to which her refusal had
brought him. For a moment she did not answer
the entreaty in his eyes. She walked to the open
window and looked out on the night. Tarsis had
planned shrewdly in keeping this for the last card
to play. In her state of mind it was the one
appeal that could have the effect he desired. To
Hera the offer did seem the only way that remained
of serving honor as well as saving herself
from what she contemplated as a loathsome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
degradation. The inevitable misery of the sort
of relation he proposed rose before her mind;
but of her happiness she thought no more, so eager
was she to mitigate in some degree the wrong of
which she perceived he must be the greater victim.
Presently Tarsis was at her side again, saying:</p>

<p>“Will you do this? Be my wife only in name.
On these terms, if you will, you may redeem your
promise&mdash;you may save me.”</p>

<p>And wishing to do that&mdash;wishing to save him,
to do him justice&mdash;swayed, too, by pity for him
and remorse for her broken promise, and crushed
in spirit by her disappointment in Mario&mdash;she
yielded.</p>

<p>“There is no other way,” she said, turning to
him, wearily&mdash;“no other way to screen you&mdash;to
meet the demand of honor.”</p>

<p>He caught up her hand and kissed it.</p>

<p>“You will never regret this act of justice,”
he said, confident that his complete triumph was
only a matter of time. Perhaps he betrayed the
working of his mind in some unguarded gleam of
the eye, some play of the lip, for she said to him,
her manner showing grave determination:</p>

<p>“Don’t think I shall change&mdash;that you can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
swerve me in the least from this position. You
must foster no false hopes. When I become your
wife I shall remain to the last only that in appearance&mdash;in
the eyes of the world. In reality I shall
be as far removed from you as if I were actually
married to another. I tell you this as emphatically
as possible, because it is only just that you
clearly understand what our marriage will mean
to both.”</p>

<p>“All is quite clear,” Tarsis returned, cunningly.</p>

<p>“Oh, it is a terrible deed!” she exclaimed, the
consequences rising to her mind and filling it with
horror. “Think well, I beg of you. In despoiling
me of my life’s happiness you are going to ruin
your own. Perhaps you did not think I should
make the conditions so absolute, so irrevocable.
If you wish to withdraw your offer do so, and save
us from a lot that can not fail to be one of misery
so long as we both are alive.”</p>

<p>She had only multiplied his motives for wishing
to make her his wife. She understood him even
less than he understood her. At no time before
had her beauty made such a living appeal to him.
Until now it had never been his privilege to behold
her when emotion was at play. Her outward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
image of loveliness was all she had ever revealed
to him. The voice she gave him in the past was
not the passionate one he had just heard; the soul
her eyes had mirrored was not the one that looked
from them when she spoke the name of Mario
Forza. The heave of her bosom, the come and go
of carnation in her cheeks, the tides of tenderness
that rose amid her promises of a vehement strength,
portrayed to him a Hera he had not known before&mdash;a
woman he would have given all his vast
fortune to win.</p>

<p>“What you have said does not deter me,” he
told her, “though I apprehend the situation as
fully as you wish me to. I accept.”</p>

<p>And thus the thread of the story took a new
twist, but one of which Aunt Beatrice never
learned, nor did Don Riccardo.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />

<span class="smaller">A WEDDING JOURNEY</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> noon they kneeled before the Cardinal of
Milan, in the great white cathedral, speaking the
words that welded their bonds. It was an hour
of gray skies, and the many-hued sunshine that
often had sifted through the great stained glass
windows to felicitate a bride did not fall upon
Hera. The gay world of Lombardy was there,
filling the transept with its silks and jewels, and
in the backward parts of the nave and aisles common
folk looked on at the famous wedding.</p>

<p>There was to be a breakfast in Villa Barbiondi,
and when the ceremony at the altar was over
some of the princes and dukes and marquises,
with their dames, followed Tarsis and his bride
to the main door. In the journals of that evening
were the names of the ladies and gentlemen who
composed the brilliant procession, with details,
more or less accurate, as to the gowns.</p>

<p>Other particulars of the event, within the
cathedral and without, were set down minutely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
by press men and press women. They told of the
concourse of people in the square&mdash;hundreds of
them idle working folk; how they crowded the
steps before the church, and how the Civil Guards
kept open a lane to the carriages of the bridal
party; but no mention was made of the sullen
faces bordering that lane.</p>

<p>Nor was there any account of the doings of
La Ferita, the woman of the scarred face, who
shook her fist at Tarsis. Before he came from
the church she had annoyed the Civil Guards by
crying out: “Joy to the bridegroom! Death to
the children in his factories!” The guards gave
her a final warning, which she understood; and
when Tarsis passed by her tongue was stilled,
but the long scar glowed and her eyes looked
savage hatred. Tarsis saw the woman shaking
her fist at him, and so did Hera. In after days he
was aware of that face, with its deep red mark
running across one eyelid from forehead to cheekbone.
Another detail overlooked or purposely
omitted by the conservative press was the low
muttering against the bridegroom that sounded
here and there in the crowd.</p>

<p>The nuptial cortege started for the railway<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
station. In Corso Vittorio Emanuele it passed
a café where a youthful artist, in satirical mood,
was amusing some comrades with his pencil. He
threw off a cartoon of the wedding. It depicted
the bridegroom receiving a blow on the nose from
the brawny fist of a workman; and in the place of
blood there flowed&mdash;gold pieces! The editor of
a revolutionary journal picked it up, and while
the merry breakfast at the villa was in progress
the thing circulated, filling many of the Milanese
with delight and moving others to indignation.</p>

<p>Tarsis and his bride set off for Paris by the night
express. The station master at Milan greeted
them as they alighted from the train that bore
them from the Brianza, and with many a bow and
smile conducted them to the private car in which
they were to travel as only the King and the
Queen travel in Italy. The ceremonious tribute
of the conductor and the guards as they passed
along the platform tickled the vanity of Tarsis
in no small degree. To the keen eye his manner
betrayed the pride he felt in this public display
of his husbandship to the beautiful daughter of
the aristocracy who walked by his side.</p>

<p>That was Hera’s thought when they were seated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
in their moving drawing-room. Oddly enough
she found herself studying his attire. She recalled
that hitherto it had never given her any distinct
impression; he had always appeared dressed in the
height of fashion, with a certain mercantile brilliancy
best described, perhaps, as stylish. Now
it seemed that he looked a trifle too much like a
bridegroom. In this moment she awoke sharply
to the truth that he was, irreparably, for better or
for worse, her husband. Again she heard the
solemn voice of the cardinal proclaiming, “This
bond may not be severed so long as you do live.”
Before, the fact had not assumed a phase of such
vivid actuality; it all had been so utterly opposed
to the current of her thoughts and the desire of
her heart. Now the trial she had accepted in a
sentiment of duty came home to her in its practical
aspect. And in the spirit of a gentlewoman
she resolved to meet the situation with good grace.
As well look the fact in the eye and make the best
of it. Then and there she decided that under
the chafing of the yoke she would not fret and lose
her peace.</p>

<p>It turned out that the wedding journey began
with a pleasant surprise for Tarsis. He found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
his wife a most cheerful companion. She talked
with him lightly and let her laughter ripple. Of
course, she overplayed the part in her first essay.
But Tarsis, in his exultation, was completely <i>hors
de critique</i>. This unexpected melting of his iceberg
produced cups of vanity which went to his
head and intoxicated him to the verge of blindness.
All he could see was his own supposed success in
making himself agreeable to his wife. After
dinner, when the attendant had set out the Marsala
and cigars, she bade him smoke, and while he did
so she read to him from the Milanese <i>Firefly</i>.
Together they laughed over the droll jests and
anecdotes told so quaintly in the Lombardian
patter. He told her about his career in the money-making
world; how success there was once his
only aspiration, but that now he was aware of a
waning zest in the game. He paused to look into
her eyes, while a certain softness, as of meek appeal,
showed in his own. Then he said, rising and
standing near her chair:</p>

<p>“Life holds only one prize for me to-day. It is
your tender regard.”</p>

<p>A deep tide of colour dyed Hera’s cheeks, and,
without making other reply, she turned her head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
and gazed upon the sparkling electric lamps of a
village that was sailing by. A moment more, and
she rose, but only to bid him good-night and withdraw
to the compartment prepared for her.
Tarsis followed her with his eyes, an amused smile
on his lips, and when she had disappeared he took
a cigar from the box, lighted it, and threw himself
into a long-cushioned chair. For an hour he stayed
there, meditative, cheerful, while the train wound
and climbed and burrowed its way across the Alps.</p>

<p>In the late afternoon they rolled into a gloomy
terminal station of the French capital. It had
been a day of rain clouds with short-lived intervals
of clear sky; and while on their way to an obscure
but aristocratic hotel on the left bank of the Seine
they saw Paris in one of her happiest moments&mdash;a
period of sunshine between showers. There was
an air of gladness about the passing throngs&mdash;a
momentary lift of spirits imparted by the smiling
heavens; the wet pavements glistened, as did the
oil-cloths of cabmen and gendarmes, and the
moving life everywhere gave forth a lightened
resonance. But before they reached the hotel
umbrellas were up, and Paris was cross again.</p>

<p>So the weather served them nearly every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
hour of their week’s stay. Tarsis made no effort
to reapproach the theme of “tender regard,” and
Hera seemed to enter heartily into the enjoyment
of the amusements he provided. The opera had
no auditor more pleased than she, and when they
drove in the Bois&mdash;between showers&mdash;she saw
so many things in the spring’s unfolding, and
talked about them so brightly, that Tarsis found
himself interested for once in the wonders of
nature’s workshop. She had put on the armour of
contentment, believing he would perceive that
she wore it not only in kindness but from a sense
of duty consequent upon the giving of her hand.
She believed that he would comprehend as well
that it was meant no less for self-defence than for
self-effacement. Upon his keenness of intellect
she had counted, and not in vain. He read her
declaration as clearly as if she had written it in the
plainest of Tuscan words: The lot he had chosen
was the one by which he must abide; her armour of
contentment was so frail that it might be broken
by even an essay on his part at disturbing the
status quo to which he had agreed. All this he
appreciated and made believe to accept as her
immutable law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>The wedding journey took its course over the
English Channel. In London Hera found many
letters from Italy. From Aunt Beatrice there
were four precisely written pages, over which
the sage spinster had spread her dictum, with a
fine tone of authority, on the amenities of wifehood.
The letter from Don Riccardo breathed tenderness
and sympathy, but proved a fresh reminder of the
frail nature that was her father’s. He charged
her that the Barbiondi were not made for slavery.
Never must she sink under the burden of her
marriage. If ever it became too heavy to bear
with honour she must cast it off, come what might.
Well he knew the sacrifice she was making. Was
the father’s heart to be deceived because the
daughter was too brave to come to him with her
trouble? Ah, no!</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Beloved Hera,” he went on, “your absence
tears my heart. Oh, fate! Why could it not
have spared us enough to live in our humble peace?
But no&mdash;ah, well, why weep over the irreparable?
<i>A chi tocca, tocca.</i> Is it not so? With my warmest
blessing and prayers most ardent for your
happiness, I am your affectionate</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Babbo.</span>”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>Hera was able to utter a heartfelt thanksgiving
that her father had not urged her to the marriage.
She was glad he had done nothing in that affair
to lessen the respect for him which she mingled
with her love. There was a letter from a comrade
of the Brianza&mdash;the little Marchioness di Tramonta;
she wrote from the eminence of almost a
year of married life. Letters from girl friends&mdash;dainty
missives in cream and lilac&mdash;conveyed
glowing wishes for a bright future.</p>

<p>Typewritten letters in printed envelopes had
haunted Tarsis from the hour of his arrival in
Paris. And now they pursued him to London.
Thanks to the eclipse of the honeymoon, he found
opportunity to read and answer many of them,
as well as to spend a part of the day in Lombard
street on “urgent matters of business,” as he
explained to his bride.</p>

<p>Hera sent her father a most cheerful reply.
“To-day,” she said, in closing, “I have had an
interesting experience in dreary London. I promised
you to pay a visit to the Duchess of Claychester.
I did so this afternoon, and I am glad
indeed. You did not tell me, <i>babbo</i>, that the
Duchess is one of those English ladies of whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
we read in Italy because of their work among the
poor. We had luncheon in her house in Cavendish
Square, then went to a place called a ‘settlement,’
of which she is chief patroness. It is a large
modern building in the midst of the most squalid
section of Marylebone&mdash;a quarter, I am told, that
for human wretchedness is worse than the East
End one hears so much about in the novels. My
heart turned sick at the sights. Is it possible that
we have anything so bad in Milan? Signor Forza
told me of the poor of our Porta Ticinese quarter
and I have heard about them from others. I
have never been there, yet I cannot believe it
equals the miserable life of this London slum.
Now, what I saw gave me an idea. And what do
you think it is? That I may be useful in the
world! Yes, and in the way that the Duchess
of Claychester is; but among our own people
in Milan. I learned all that I could about the
work.</p>

<p>“They have women called ‘visitors’ who go to
the homes of the poor people, and with one of
these I went for an hour or more. It was an
experience I shall never forget. She told me that
she had to employ rare tact sometimes, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
there were men and women in the slums who
objected to being ‘elevated’ or ‘ameliorated.’ It
was so that my guide expressed it. We had a
striking proof of the fact in one place. The family
consisted of a very small woman, a very large man,
and two wee girls. That they were in need anyone
could see. As soon as we entered the man acted
like a hunted animal at bay. The visitor was a
woman of severe manner, and I must say that I
did not detect in the way she went about this case
any of that ‘rare tact’ which she said was so
necessary. ‘Charity!’ the man roared back at her
(I give it in his own language), ‘who asks yer
bloody charity? What we wants is justice, we do.
An’ justice we’ll ’ave some day, yer bet yer
boots!’ He shook his fist in the visitor’s face, and
his wife tugged at his coat, saying: ‘Be-ive yerself,
’Enry; be-ive yerself!’</p>

<p>“The visitor thought it time to go, and
I agreed with her. These English! These
English!</p>

<p>“It has rained every day since we left Italy. In
France we caught a peep of the sun now and then;
here, never. If ever again I stand under our skies
I shall rejoice. Before I thought of being useful it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
seemed that those skies could never be bright,
and I dreaded going back. But now, oh, how
eager I am to be there! Ever your affectionate
daughter, who counts the hours until she shall
see you,</p>

<span class="smaller">A SEED OF GRATITUDE</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the evening they departed from Charing
Cross, and without interruption their journey to
France was accomplished. When a day had
come and gone the Alpine solitudes were behind
them, and they beheld once more the Arcadian
valleys of Vaudois. Soon after that they moved
in the sunlight over stretches of Lombardian plain.
Now the azure above them resembled the sky
color of pictures in old missals. How beautiful
it was to Hera’s eyes! She felt the irresistible
charm of the prospect, even as the barbarians did
in ancient days. She wondered if it was any
different then. Through all time those plains
seemed to have been under the husbandman’s
rule, ever fruitful, ever smiling in their bright
verdure.</p>

<p>Tarsis lowered a window and the breath of
springtime fanned their faces. It brought a
delicious freshness from the little man-made
streamlets that, catching the heavens’ mood,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
wove a blue network over the land, and sparkled
in the sun-play like great strings of precious stones.
In their purpose of irrigation they crossed the
white highroads and the by-paths, coursed in
sluices under the railway, and cut the fields how
and where they pleased, too well bent upon practical
service to care for symmetry of form. They
drew near one another, they rambled far apart,
but in the end always meeting in the wide canal
that bore elsewhere their enriching flood; and so
forever running, yet never wasted. A few weeks,
and this pampered soil would render its marvellous
account; the meadows would yield their many
harvests; the rice stalks would be crowded with
ears; the clover would be like a blossoming thicket,
the cornfields like canebrakes; but the men and
women who toiled to produce this abundance
would live on in their poverty. The clod-breakers
were there again to-day&mdash;as they had been with
the returning springtime for ages, about their
work&mdash;boys digging trenches, ploughmen at their
shafts, women and girls planting seed.</p>

<p>Hera noticed that the villages along the way
had not the neat and cheerful look of the French
and Swiss hamlets. Seen from afar, crowning a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
hilltop, their tiled roofs brightly red in the sun-glare,
and the yellow walls gleaming like burnished
gold, the pictorial expression of them was full of
beauty; but when the train halted in the heart of
one, and its wretchedness lay bare, her spirit was
saddened by the grim reality.</p>

<p>“I mean to do something to help the poor of
Milan,” she said to Tarsis, one of the gloomy pictures
haunting her memory.</p>

<p>“You have chosen a wide field of good endeavour,”
he returned, in a slight tone of banter.</p>

<p>“And I wonder why the field is so wide,” she
pursued. “Milan is called our City Prosperous.”</p>

<p>“I think the reason is not difficult to find,”
he said, with assurance.</p>

<p>“Do you mean that the poor are unworthy?”</p>

<p>“No; I should not give that as the first cause;
it is a result. This sentimental nonsense called
the New Democracy has turned working people’s
heads. It gives them puffed-up notions of their
value, and they will not work for the wages that
the masters offer&mdash;the wages that it is possible
for them to pay. They spend too much time
talking about the dignity of labour. If only they
would work for what they can get and not squander<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
their wages in the wine-shops they would be
well enough off. They want too much; more than
they will ever get. Their warfare against capital
only hurts themselves.”</p>

<p>“Do they want more than they need?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“I am not familiar with their needs,” he answered,
with a note of petulance. “I do know,
however, that they often demand more than it is
possible to pay. I am not a theorist. I happen
to have gained my knowledge in the school of
practice, as you may be aware.”</p>

<p>“Still, suffering exists among them,” she reasoned,
“and, while the fault may be as you say, the
families of these men&mdash;misguided though they
may be&mdash;are the victims rather than the culprits.
I suppose it would be only common humanity to
give them help.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; that is true,” he acknowledged.
“The women and children have to play martyr
while the men indulge in what our new economists
delight to call divine discontent. By the way,”
he went on, “I am paying some charitable concern
five thousand liras a year.”</p>

<p>His manner told her that it was a benefice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
ungraced by a sense of moral obligation; that he
merely had followed the example of modern rich
men by returning a part of his tremendous revenue
in benefactions to the public.</p>

<p>“It is good to give heart to the disheartened,
relief to the suffering,” she said, holding up a
journal they had obtained at Turin. “Have you
seen this account of disorders in the Porta Ticinese
quarter? I fear there is a hungry mouth in Milan
that will show its teeth some day.”</p>

<p>Tarsis could hear the voice of Mario Forza. He
betrayed a twitching of the lips, but tried to carry
it off with a careless smile, as he said:</p>

<p>“I suppose the money is put to good use. Precisely
how they disburse it I do not know. The
secretary sends printed reports, but I have not
read them.”</p>

<p>There was a quality of absence in his manner,
accounted for by the fact that his mind was busying
itself with Hera’s remark about the hungry
mouth. While in Paris he had received by post
from unknown senders not one but many copies
of the newspaper that contained the picture of his
punched nose and its plenteous flow of gold pieces.
Then the cartoon had seemed to him merely one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
more shaft of malice aimed at a successful man.
In his career of achievement he had steeled his
sensibility against criticism, rating it as the twin
brother of envy, and borrowing no disquiet on
either score; but now, grace to the chance observation
of Hera, he saw the cartoon with a new and
clearer eye. He perceived the force at work
behind it&mdash;the popular ill-will, which gave such
point to the product of the artist’s pencil; and he
apprehended, as he never had before, that herein
smouldered an ember easily fanned to flame.</p>

<p>He had accustomed himself to meeting difficulties
promptly, and turning apparent disadvantage
to a factor of self-service. Now he reflected&mdash;and
the thought gleamed shrewdly in his half-closed
eyes&mdash;that this ember of peril might be
smothered with a few handfuls of those coins, which
were his by right of conquest, though the growing
madness of the time found them so ignoble.
Indeed, it was an excellent idea&mdash;this one of his
wife&mdash;to throw a bone to the snarling dogs. He
would give her charitable whim his countenance,
even his unstinted support. He would let his
wife scatter largesse among the malcontents; let
her shine as the doer of good deeds, but the world<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
would know&mdash;the house of Barbiondi had no name
for wealth&mdash;the workers would applaud Antonio
Tarsis, friend of the poor. Moreover, this co-operation
would place his wife under an obligation to
him, give her one more proof of his desire to
gratify her every wish. So he said to her, at the
moment that the train entered the suburbs of
Milan:</p>

<p>“I count it noble of you, Hera, to have a care
for the unfortunate. A little thought convinces
me that you are right in your view. There are
times when we should not stop to reason why.”</p>

<p>“I am glad that we can see alike in this,” she
said. “There is joy, I know, in giving.”</p>

<p>“And I wish to be in accord with you. Believe
me, you have my warmest sympathy in whatever
work you contemplate. As to funds, I need not
tell you that my fortune is at your disposal.”</p>

<p>“You are most generous; I thank you,” she
said, and told him of the plan conceived in London.</p>

<p>In the station they saw Don Riccardo and his
sister coming down the platform to welcome them.</p>

<p>“<i>Babbo!</i>” Hera cried out before her father
caught sight of her, and the next moment she was
in his arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, truant!” he said, holding her hands and
swinging them, while he looked into her eyes as if
to read their secret. “I have you again. And
you come to stay. Is it not so, my treasure?”</p>

<p>“You may be sure of that, <i>babbo</i>!” she laughed,
and turned to receive her aunt’s caresses. “Here
I am and here I stay. Long live Italia is my song,
and I think Antonio will join in the chorus.”</p>

<p>“With all my heart!” Tarsis said genially,
his hopes taking a sudden bound. It was the
first time she had addressed him by his Christian
name.</p>

<p>Never had anyone seen Hera in better spirits.
It was good to be once more in the land she loved,
to hear again the familiar “minga” and “lu” of
her native patter; but the real inspiration of her
gladness, although the fact did not appear to her
mind, was that she had come to dwell in the city
whose walls enclosed Mario Forza, and whose air
he breathed. Aunt Beatrice accepted her lightness
of heart triumphantly as a tribute to her own
splendid work as a matchmaker. Tarsis’s automobile
awaited them, and they got in, all four.
Hera noted that the crest of her house was painted
none too small on the olive green sides of the car.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>Through the spick and span wide, modern
streets they rolled to the Barbiondi palace. Milan
was gayly picturesque in her springtime magic
of light and colour. An impress of the Gothic
feeling met the eye in buildings that recalled
where they did not typify the pointed architecture
of the north. They passed a procession of priests
and acolytes following a crozier that flashed the
sunlight. Here and there, at a street corner, a
public porter slept peacefully while awaiting a
call to work. For a minute or two they were in the
busy movement of Via Manzoni. Cavalry officers
in bright uniforms lounged at the outdoor tables
of the cafés, or dragged their sabres lazily amid
the throngs of civilians.</p>

<p>Then they entered a quieter way, that yielded
vistas of courtyards with frescoed walls, arcades
clad in climbing greenery, playing fountains; and
at the next turning they were in sight of Palazzo
Barbiondi. For two months artisans had been
at work restoring the ancient family seat to life
and splendour. In point of splendour Tarsis had
done somewhat more than recall the past. As
they approached the arched gateway Don Riccardo
exclaimed at sight of the newly-coloured iron<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
palings tipped with gilt. The fountain in the
court was playing. Out of the pool rose an Apollo
Musagetes, and from his crown a sparkling shower
shot down in diverging lines to symbolise the sun’s
rays, or&mdash;as the Greeks had it&mdash;the arrows of
Apollo. The side walls of the court were frescoed
with the Barbiondi crown and the “Lux in tenebras
lucet” of the once haughty and powerful
house.</p>

<p>A corps of domestics in livery of white and olive
were waiting, lined on either side of the main
entrance. The fountain statues and all the marble
ornamenture of the court had been despoiled of
their yellow <i>patina</i>, and showed once more in
native white. The façade of the palace&mdash;accounted
one of the noblest in the North&mdash;had been
spared by the renovator, but its grand staircase,
rising from one side of the wide portico, and its
carved balustrade, were as white as St. Bernard’s
peak. Everywhere that the artisans could turn
back the clock they had done so by dint of
scouring and scraping, painting and stuccoing,
chiselling and carving, tearing out and building
in.</p>

<p>Don Riccardo paused at the opening to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
grand staircase and looked up at the armorial
bearings of his house done in stone.</p>

<p>“Bacco!” he exclaimed, “we are the first Barbiondi
to set foot here for more than a hundred
years.”</p>

<p>It was in the Duke’s heart to denounce the
fungous nobility and shop-keeping snobs who had
from time to time violated his ancestral home with
their occupancy; but in the presence of Tarsis
he bridled his tongue.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is indeed more than a hundred years,”
remarked Donna Beatrice, adjusting her lorgnette.
“Our eighteenth Riccardo was the last of the line
to dwell here. With this day, Antonio,” she
added, beaming upon the bridegroom, “we may
say with literal truth that the restoration begins.
Ah, that eighteenth Duke was an open-handed
nobleman&mdash;a lord of regal expenditure. Lombardy
never had so liberal a patron of the beautiful
arts. These mural paintings, I believe, are the
fruit of his munificence.”</p>

<p>“Yes; our great grandfather,” mused the living
Duke, casting his eye about the stairway. “Still,
I should be none the less proud of him had he
lavished less on his walls and more on his posterity.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>They ascended the broad steps, and Donna
Beatrice, primed with the lore of the place, began
to radiate her knowledge. The staircase, with its
balustrade of richly carved Carrara, she announced
was a product of Vanitelli, and the solitary work
Milan possessed of that great architect. This
acquisition, as well as many more to which she
drew his attention, proved a surprise to the new
lord of the palace. The idea of buying the mediæval
pile came to Tarsis&mdash;so he believed&mdash;as an
inspiration, and he had lost not a second in giving
it practical form. Accompanied by the owner&mdash;a
Genoese money-lender&mdash;he went there one morning,
and spent something less than half an hour
looking about the palace, the stables, and the
grounds. Before the day was out he had bound
the bargain with his check. Within twenty-four
hours the contractor and his gang attacked the
house, armed with authority to renovate and
restore.</p>

<p>It was with a newly-awakened interest, therefore&mdash;not
unmixed with an appreciation of its
humorous side&mdash;that Tarsis listened to Donna
Beatrice’s running talk. In a manner that made
him think of the guides in the Brera Gallery she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
reeled off the history of this painting or that
medallion, explained the frescoes of the ceiling,
and identified the busts in the niches, with their
age-old faces shining again like newly scrubbed
schoolboys.</p>

<p>A sculptured frieze that bordered the staircase
pictured a battle between the Lombards and the
Barbiondi in the days of King Alboin. Above
it, following the long flight of steps, unfolded a
panorama of scenes from the life of Mary. At the
top of the staircase, set in the wall, was a trophy
that had been sawed out of a church by some
conquering Barbiondi. It depicted St. Mark
preaching at Alexandria. In the banquet hall
were some less pious conceptions of beauty.
Here the mural art found expression in a hunting
scene and a mediæval dance with the hills of the
Brianza in the background.</p>

<p>The grand saloon&mdash;a gorgeous chamber in
marble and gold&mdash;was worthy of a royal abode.
It had been known for centuries as the Atlantean
chamber. Engaging the eye before all else were
two rows of Atlantes supporting the ceiling on
either side, all of heroic size. They were equal
in number to the windows, between which they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
rested on pedestals of grained marble. A huge
fist of each gripped a bronze candelabra of many
lights. Their torsos were undraped, but the rest
of them was lost in chiselled oak leaves. On the
ceiling pink sea nymphs sported in silvery foam
and gods and angels revelled in rosy vapours.
Through the stained glass of a dome the sun
flowed down upon the mellow fairness of the tessellated
pavement.</p>

<p>They all paused before a large painting. It
was a vivid picture of Italy’s chief industry during
the era of her free cities&mdash;men slaying one another
in furious combat. Where the glory of war shone
brightest&mdash;where the blood flowed fastest&mdash;there
could be seen a great car, drawn by oxen, flying
the standard of Milan, and bearing an altar with
the host. The leather-clad warriors of the time
called it their <i>caroccio</i>. Like the Israelites’
ark of the covenant, it was a rallying point
in battle, and reminded the artisans that
they had a church as well as a city to fight
for.</p>

<p>“It is the car of Heribert,” said Hera, for the
enlightenment of Tarsis, “an Archbishop of
Milan. He was of our race.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>“And the inventor of the <i>caroccio</i>,” added
Donna Beatrice, proudly.</p>

<p>“And the first labour agitator. Isn’t that so?”
put in Don Riccardo, keeping a straight face.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what that is,” replied his sister.</p>

<p>“Signor Tarsis can tell you, perhaps,” the other
suggested.</p>

<p>“A labour agitator?” Tarsis repeated. “Why,
I should define him as a breeder of discontent
and a foe to the public peace.”</p>

<p>“If that definition be fair,” Hera rejoined
earnestly, “Heribert was indeed a labour agitator.
Undeniably he sowed discontent, but discontent
against injustice.”</p>

<p>“And what was his particular method?” asked
Tarsis, smiling as if to make light of her remark
and keeping his eyes on the mimic warfare.</p>

<p>“He gave tongue to a hitherto voiceless people,”
she answered, “and made them into an army, so
that they were able not only to express their
wrongs but to fight for their rights.” The words
seemed to have a present-day meaning, and with
her companions’ perception of the fact the name
of Mario Forza leaped into their minds. It
stirred them, one and all, to a fresh appreciation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
that the man she had made no secret of loving
was still a prevalent force in her life; her thoughts
were in sympathy with his, the colours he gave
to the world were the colours in which she beheld
it.</p>

<p>To her father’s face the incident brought a look
of pity; it caused Donna Beatrice to screw up her
little features into wrinkles of disgust, and in the
changing glances of Tarsis it was easy to read a
rising tide of resentment. When he spoke it was
in the cold vein of mockery whereof on occasion
he could be master.</p>

<p>“The rights of labour,” he said, “are, of course,
the only rights that a nation should consider.
We have a new wisdom in Italy&mdash;it has come in
with the New Democracy&mdash;the wisdom that is
blind to the rights of capital and laughs at the
idea of its having any virtue; all the prosperity
our country enjoys to-day, understand, is due to
the champions of the horny-fisted&mdash;the dreamers
of the Camera. Is not that the fact, Don
Riccardo?”</p>

<p>“To be precise,” the Duke answered, “I don’t
know.”</p>

<p>“Surely you must be aware,” his son-in-law<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
asserted, “that it is not men like myself who are
giving the country what she needed so long&mdash;the
breath of industrial life. Oh, no; it is our critics
who are doing this, the silver-tongued doctrinaires.
They would give us a very different sort of industry&mdash;the
sort you see in that picture. Strife and
bloodshed were the business of that day, and will
be in ours, depend upon it, unless a stronger hand
rules at Rome.”</p>

<p>“What do you think ought to be done?” asked
Donna Beatrice, frightened by the black forecast.</p>

<p>“Done? The thing is simple. The Government
should take measures to silence these mischief-makers,
these plotters against industrial peace.
We build up the wealth of the nation, they would
tear it down. They delude themselves with the
notion that they are the only patriots. How
delicious! They are Italy’s deadliest foes.”</p>

<p>“I tremble to think of the consequences,” said
Donna Beatrice. “Why, our heads would not
be safe. See how those blacksmiths and clod-hoppers
lay about them with their pikes and terrible
swords! I suppose the heads they are
cracking are the heads that wouldn’t take in
their new ideas! Ugh!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p>“Still, the world is somewhat hard for many,”
Don Riccardo observed, for the sake of a word in
support of Hera, who had moved away, resolved
not to join issue with her husband.</p>

<p>“I have always found the world what I made it,”
Tarsis returned, and they passed on toward the
door of the library. The contractor had stocked
the massive oak shelves with volumes old and
new, and supplied the room with modern leather
furniture.</p>

<p>“Oh, the Napoleonic relic!” exclaimed Donna
Beatrice at sight of a large oblong table of Florentine
mosaic. Tarsis was all attention.</p>

<p>“Napoleonic relic?” he asked. “What do
you mean?”</p>

<p>“Ah, you must know,” she told him, “that
when the conqueror came to Milan he made the
palace his headquarters. This table was once in
Villa Barbiondi, and my great-grandfather gave
it to Napoleon.”</p>

<p>Tarsis drew a chair to the table, and, with
a nod of apology to the others, seated himself;
resting his arms on the polished surface, he moved
his right hand in simulation of the act of writing.</p>

<p>“It is of convenient height,” he said, “and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
shall use it. I cannot tell you how pleased I am
to find this relic. Napoleon Bonaparte is the
man above all the world’s heroes whom I admire.”</p>

<p>“Truly a marvellous man, a matchless genius,”
attested Donna Beatrice, gravely contemplative.</p>

<p>“From childhood his life has been my guiding
star,” Tarsis continued. “And to possess, to
use the table that he used, is a privilege I never
thought to enjoy. And the work itself,” he
added, rising and drawing back to admire it,
with an interest which no other object of art in the
palace had been able to awaken in him, “is
it not magnificent?”</p>

<p>“Quite a treasure,” acquiesced Don Riccardo,
showing more concern in the bookcases, which he
was sweeping with his eyes; but for Hera&mdash;explain
it she could not&mdash;the thing inspired a strange
aversion&mdash;a feeling that came vividly to her mind
in after days when that table played its tragic part
in the destiny of the man she called husband.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE DOOR OF FRA PANDOLE</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> followed Donna Beatrice and Tarsis
across the figured expanse of pavement, down
the grand staircase and through the portico to
the gardens. Beyond the yellow wall at the
backward limit they could see the red roofs of
Via Cappuccini&mdash;humble abodes of workmen
partly screened by the trees. All about them
nature had opened her poetry book. Plants in
the great urns were dappled with snowy fairness,
the maples showed richly green, the magnolias
were unfolding their eager beauty, and the air
was rapturous with the voices of birds. When
they had looked upon the row of swishing tails
in the stable and surveyed the store of motor cars
Donna Beatrice remarked to Tarsis, she and he
standing apart from the others:</p>

<p>“I perceive that your wife cannot escape
happiness. You are giving her all that mortal
heart can wish.”</p>

<p>“I am following your advice,” he said, with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
smile that his companion did not see was cunning&mdash;“striving
to win her gratitude, you perceive.
But I fear there is no short road to her affection.”</p>

<p>“My friend,” Donna Beatrice announced, impressively,
“you are nearer to it than you believe.”</p>

<p>“Why do you think so?”</p>

<p>“Because it is inevitable,” she answered, positively.
“Besides, I have never seen our Hera
in happier mood.”</p>

<p>“Still, it may be studied,” Tarsis suggested,
out of his deeper knowledge.</p>

<p>“Oh, no: it is genuine; depend upon that.
Listen to her laughter. Has it not the true ring?
Indeed, Antonio, I confess astonishment at your
wonderful progress. For an hour I have been
aching to offer my felicitations.”</p>

<p>Tarsis bowed his acknowledgment, but with an
air of slight incertitude.</p>

<p>“I fear,” he observed, “that your felicitations,
in their kindly eagerness, come a trifle early.”</p>

<p>“Not a minute, I am sure,” Donna Beatrice
insisted.</p>

<p>“Of course, I shall succeed in the end,” he
said, with cold assurance.</p>

<p>“In the end? Oh, bravo!” she exclaimed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
in a pretty effort of raillery. “This modesty!
It is most amusing! Why, the end is already
attained. Let me tell you something: At this
moment your wife is exceedingly fond of you.”</p>

<p>“Do you know this?” he asked, a covetous
gleam in his eye.</p>

<p>“As well as I know that you are her husband.”</p>

<p>“Has she told you so?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Ha! What did she say?”</p>

<p>“She has not spoken by word of mouth. Ah,
no. A woman has other ways of revealing such
a secret. Take the word of a woman of experience
who knows how to look into the heart of her sex.”</p>

<p>“Have you looked into my wife’s heart?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And did you see there, for example, Mario
Forza?”</p>

<p>Donna Beatrice emitted a low, gurgling titter.
“Oh, my dear friend! How little you understand
womankind.”</p>

<p>“Did you hear what she said before the picture
of Heribert?”</p>

<p>“Every syllable.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you see that it was Forza talking?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>She gave him a depreciatory glance. “How
interesting! That one so keen in all else should
be in an affair like this so&mdash;so&mdash;well, so short-sighted!
To be sure, the Forza fever lingers,”
she explained, “but it is merely running its
course.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are right,” he said, his self-love
overcoming doubt.</p>

<p>“Right? Let us reflect. She realises what a
narrow escape she had from that sickness. Still,
a woman does not surrender too easily. Our Hera
is no fool. How can she, in the light of reason&mdash;in
any light&mdash;prefer Mario Forza to Antonio
Tarsis? The idea is absurd.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At dinner Hera, queenly in a gown that effected
the complement of her own beautiful coloring,
was gracious, kindly, captivating. Like an actress
who had played a rôle many times, she was settling
into her part. To the land of self-conceit
where Tarsis dwelt the voice of this human
heart did not penetrate; he heard only its delusive
echo. Even the clear admonition she had sounded
at Paris failed to weigh now against his self-exaltation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
and the false notion that Donna
Beatrice had planted in his mind. Thus it fell
out that when Don Riccardo and his sister had
taken themselves away he said to her, while they
lingered at the window, looking upon the lights
of the Corso:</p>

<p>“It affords me infinite pleasure, my wife, to
see you so happy.”</p>

<p>“All the worldly means are at hand,” she
responded, in the manner of one conceding a
point, “and I should be lacking in a sense of
values if I were not content. You can do no
more, Antonio.”</p>

<p>“It is all paltry enough,” he declared, in a
sudden burst of feeling, “when I reflect that it
is done for you. There is nothing that I would
not do for your sake.”</p>

<p>With the words he caught up her hand and
kissed it fervidly. She did not turn her eyes from
the window or withdraw her hand; for a moment
he stood holding it, looking into her averted
face, like one who had asked a question and was
awaiting the answer.</p>

<p>“The dinner was delightful,” she said, at length,
moving from him. “There is much to do to-morrow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
and I shall retire early. You have your
occupations, no doubt. For your many kindnesses
I thank you.”</p>

<p>She disengaged her hand and wished him good-night,
all with an admirable effect of significance,
tempered by well-bred dignity: but the peasant
cunning that was in his blood asserted itself.
Even while she spoke he bowed again and again,
with an insinuating air of comprehension, and
instead of returning her good-night he offered an
“Au revoir, eh?” to which Hera gave no response.</p>

<p>He followed her with his eyes, foolishly believing
that she might pause at the threshold and look
back. When she had passed from the room and
he could see her no longer, but heard still the
quick rustle of silk, he moved to another point
of view, and watched her retreating figure until
it disappeared at a door, where a maid waited,
far down the mirrored passage. It was the
entrance to that regal chamber whither he had
conducted her a few hours before and proclaimed
with plebeian delight&mdash;on the authority of Donna
Beatrice&mdash;that it was a part of the private suite
occupied by many dukes and duchesses of her house
and in times yet older by the rulers of Milan, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
the Barbiondi had given the free city seven of
its lords. The couch was modern, but its tester
and rich hanging of tapestries, though new from
the loom, retained the genius of the past in pattern
and phase of colour. And yonder the lord was
wont to repose, in a chamber likewise beautiful,
set apart by a mid-room, and beyond this a door
of mahogany, embellished with Madonnas and
saints and cherubs, carved for the glory of God by
Fra Pandole, famed for his pictures in wood.</p>

<p>Presently the reflection of Tarsis passed from
one to another of the corridor mirrors and he
entered the bed-chamber of the Barbiondi lords.
He found his valet there, busy yet with his task
of unpacking and putting in order. When the
man had helped him into his dressing-gown and
gone his way, Tarsis turned low the light and
threw himself on a settle so placed as to hold
in view the corridor through his half-open door.
There he watched and waited, puffing a
cigarette.</p>

<p>From Via Cappuccini came the familiar sounds
of a conscript’s <i>festa</i>&mdash;some newly-drafted soldier
and his comrades celebrating a long-dreaded event
in wine-born merriment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>“Long live the army! Long live the King!
Long live the people!”</p>

<p>A minute more and Tarsis’s vigil ended. He
saw Hera’s maid pass in the corridor on her way
to the servants’ quarters. Then he arose and
approached the door of Fra Pandole. It was
closed, but his interpretations of the past hour
made him blindly confident that it would yield
to the turning of the knob. He was on the point
of turning it when he heard the sharp click of a
key in the lock, then the sound of receding
footsteps.</p>

<p>In the sudden impulse of his rage he threw
himself against the door, crying, “Open, open!
I am your husband! It is my right!”</p>

<p>But the door did not swing, and from the other
side came no answer. With a Sicilian malediction
on his lips, Tarsis moved away to the window to
stand in the cool of the night air. The new conscript
and his comrades, passing below, sent up
a fresh gust of tipsy laughter.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="smaller">BY ROYAL COMMAND</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Public</span> announcement was made next day that
the King would arrive within the week at his
summer palace in Monza&mdash;a peaceful town reposing
at the end of two rows of stately poplars ten
miles long, with a level white road between, that
stretch in direct lines from the Venetian Gate.
Toward evening a courier in scarlet dashed into
the Barbiondi court bearing a message from the
King. It concerned the reception and dinner to
follow at which their Majesties would honour
the subject who had done so much to build up
the industries of the realm. The message was a
command that Signor Tarsis render at his earliest
convenience a list of the persons to be bidden.
This was done at once, and in two days the list
came back with a line drawn through some of the
names and other names added.</p>

<p>“His Majesty directs me to say,” wrote the
secretary, “that in view of the fact that a political
colour was deducible from the list as it stood, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
has made the changes to the end that the assemblage
may be representative of all his subjects in
the Province of Milan, so far as political complexion
is concerned. It appeared that certain
elements were overlooked, others conspicuously
recognised. Therefore, he has replaced some of
the latter with the names of two Republicans,
Signor Lingua and Signor Quattrini; one Radical,
Signor Parlari, and one leader of the New Democracy,
the Honourable Mario Forza. His Majesty
directs me to inform you that he will arrive at
Palazzo Barbiondi at seven o’clock.”</p>

<p>It was patent to Tarsis that the situation
offered no alternative; the man who had come
between him and the success he prized above
all else must be asked to partake of the hospitality
of his house. And it was equally patent to
Mario Forza, when he received the invitation,
that the royal wish might not be disregarded.
He had seen Hera driving on the Bastions; once
or twice their eyes had met; he believed that they
shared alike a yearning to speak, to have an
exchange of confidence&mdash;a desire which might
not be gratified with honour; but now by the
King’s gift this opportunity was to be theirs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
It seemed to him a gift eminently worthy of a
king. Tarsis did not deem it necessary to acquaint
his wife with what had chanced. On the
contrary, he decided to take these lovers unawares,
to watch them, and satisfy his mind as to a
suspicion that had crept into it and was gaining
strength.</p>

<p>Probably no man of intelligence in Italy was
further from understanding Mario’s political aims,
or caring to understand them, than Tarsis. And
no one understood them better than the King;
he knew that in the leader of the New Democracy
he had a stalwart friend, law and order a genuine
champion. Mario’s party had frankly accepted
the monarchy, convinced that the industrial
reforms Italy needed could be accomplished by
improving rather than pulling down the existing
form of government.</p>

<p>The duty on breadstuffs had been so high that
many thousands of mouths found it difficult
to get bread. In the past few weeks there had
been outbreaks of the people. In towns of middle
and southern Italy and Sicily mobs of men and
women had busied themselves taking food wherever
they could find it. This imitation of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
fowls of the air and the beasts of the forest worked
well enough for the feeders until the soldiers
arrived and the bullets began to whistle. One
day the King, who had never relished the campaign
against his hungry subjects, issued a decree
reducing the duty on breadstuffs. It was submitted
to Parliament and passed without speeches
for or against.</p>

<p>There was a notion in the heads of the law-makers
that if some measure of relief was not
adopted the full stomachs might not be able
to hold the empty ones at bay. Mario Forza
had much to do with inculcating that idea. He
proved himself the dangerous man his foes pronounced
him by pointing out the peril and the
means of averting it. Upon his motion the
Chamber remitted taxes on many things that the
people needed to support life, and planned public
works to give the idle an opportunity to earn food.
It voted 100,000 liras to aid the poor, and then,
feeling that it had smothered the volcano, adjourned
for a fortnight to attend the Turin
exposition, leaving the throne and the cabinet
to keep an eye on the crater.</p>

<p>It was at this juncture that the King chose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
to visit the Barbiondi palace. He had shown
his sympathy with the suffering by adding to the
Parliamentary fund for their relief 150,000 liras
from his private purse. Long before the hour for
his appearance the Milanese began to assemble,
for the most part, it is believed, bent upon giving
him an evidence of good will. They gathered
about the gates of the palace and along Corso
Venezia, through which the royal equipage was
to pass. Soon the halls and reception chambers
of the house pulsated with the voices and laughter,
the rustle and movement, that attend the arrival
of guests. A line of carriages set them down at
the portico.</p>

<p>In that stream of Lombard aristocracy was
Hera’s father, with Donna Beatrice by his side,
and many like them&mdash;men bearing noble names
who owed much to the peasant-born Tarsis.
He had swollen their fortunes by casting them for
lucrative parts in the drama that had attracted
so many gentlemen of quality&mdash;the drama of the
factory, the bank, the steamship line. Their
families made up the fashionable world of Milan.
Most of them had grand dwellings in town and
villas on the Lakes or in the Brianza; they entertained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
with radiant hospitality, drove blooded
horses, and stirred the dust of country roads
with their automobiles. Most of them were
willing to forget their titles. They belonged to
the group that was fast going away from old
ideas; the notions their fathers respected, and
which they too once respected, seemed to them
absurd and ridiculous.</p>

<p>Hera was gowned in something that shimmered
softly like the petals of a tea rose. What happened
before the day was over caused the journals to
give a more circumstantial account of the reception
than they might have done otherwise. One
of the chroniclers thus pictured Hera as she stood,
Tarsis at her side, receiving the guests, with
Heribert and his slashing warriors for a background:
“Her deep grey eyes were full of life
and expression. She moved with marvellous
grace. Her voice was sweet and melodious. Never
had anyone seen in the person of one woman
so much charm, so much beauty, united with
such brightness of intellect. She was graceful
without affectation, witty without malice, and
captivating to every guest.”</p>

<p>The Honourable Mario Forza was among the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
last to appear. He came in with the Cardinal, a
hale man of sixty, with kindly blue eyes. As
they drew near Hera felt her blood ebb and flow
and her breath catch. The elder man was the
first to be greeted, and while he paid her some
hearty compliments Mario stood alone, for Tarsis
did not offer his hand. When the Cardinal had
moved away, and they were face to face, Hera
noted with a sinking heart that the rugged glow
had gone from his cheeks, and from his eyes the
boyish lustre that had reflected a soul without
bitterness.</p>

<p>“It is a pleasure for which I am indebted to
His Majesty,” he said, as they clasped hands,
and their glances met.</p>

<p>“I am glad to see you again,” she returned,
while Tarsis, his back to the oncoming guests,
held her and the other in full survey. So intent
was he watching them that the Mayor of Milan,
a rotund little man, who stood in full regalia
waiting to be noticed, was obliged to cough
diplomatically once or twice. The hosts turned
to receive the Mayor, and Forza, with a ceremonious
bow, joined the Cardinal and passed on
to mingle with the throng.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>The guests walked and chatted or stood in
groups, awaiting the coming of the King. There
were staff officers of the garrison in gold lace;
poor noblemen of leisure and rich ones in trade,
both with their ribbons and the latter with
jewelled stars of knighthood; municipal dignitaries
in showy insignia of office; Senators and Deputies
of the several political shades; dowagers plump
or scrawny, spangled with gems, and matrons
more youthful in smart gowns. Then there
were the amusing men and women who did not
profess to be anybody in particular, yet the sort
that fashionable Milan was glad to have at its
receptions.</p>

<p>In time the clatter of tongues filled the broad
corridors as well as the great chamber, and
resounded cheerfully in the gardens, now rich
with the foliage, the blossoms, and fragrance of
May. Mario and the Cardinal joined those of the
company who had sought the cooler air, where
fountains played and magnolias cast their shadows
on statuary. A close friendship had grown with
the prelate and the statesman. The man of the
Church had taken to his heart easily the man of
the World whom he found combating a common<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
foe. Once he had said to him, “Caro Forza,
the New Democracy is an ally in the campaign
for His kingdom.” At the angle of a shaded
avenue, they met Hera on the arm of Colonel
Rosario. In genuine enthusiasm the Cardinal
gave his felicitations on the return of a Barbiondi
to the ancestral home, and Mario spoke to her
of the beauty of the palace and gardens.</p>

<p>“Colonel Rosario will not agree with you,
Signor Forza,” she said. “He deplores it all.”</p>

<p>“Pardon, Donna Hera,” the old soldier protested.
“I have not been quoted accurately,
as the politicians say. Deplore all? Far from
that. In truth, my regret is for only one thing&mdash;the
restoration.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked the Cardinal.</p>

<p>“Because, the restoration has taken unto itself
the charm of the old place.”</p>

<p>“Indeed?” the prelate inquired, looking up
at the scoured and scraped walls. “And has so
much been lost in this refinding?”</p>

<p>“Yes, your Eminence,” the soldier assured
him, as they walked away together, the man of
the sword bemoaning the passage of old Italy
and he of the red robe answering that all which
is of time must go with time. Thus it fell out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
that Mario and Hera, standing there at the turn
of the path beside the southern wall, for a moment
found themselves alone. He approached at once
the subject of the marriage that had torn their
hearts.</p>

<p>“You said that Colonel Rosario deplored it
all,” he began, repeating her words. “I interpret
that as an expression of your remorse for what&mdash;you
have done. I should not refer to the affair
but for the lingering hope that other than a sordid
motive impelled you. Must you tell me,” he
went on, a suggestion of contempt in his tone,
“that you broke faith with me because you could
not resist the pomp of great wealth&mdash;that you
preferred it to my love?”</p>

<p>At first, unable to realise that the words were
falling from his lips, she stood as one dazed; then
came the thought, and in the next instant the
delicious certainty, that there had been a misunderstanding;
that Mario, of his will, had never
surrendered her to another, that he had never
put a frigid sentiment of justice above his love for
her. But before she could speak he had misread
in her first look of bewilderment and in her
quick-going breath an acknowledgment of what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
he hated to believe. He gave voice to his anger
in phrases that wronged her immeasurably, yet
thrilled her with rapture, for they proved that
somehow he had been cheated of her, that he
had never put her away, and that after all
his was a great passion crying out in glorious
wrath.</p>

<p>“It was a hideous crime to wreck two lives,” he
exclaimed. “It has wrecked your life; that is
the penalty. When you bartered for money
all that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Mario, stop,” she said, softly, touching his
arm, while her face lit up in anticipation of the
joyous message she had for him. “We are the
victims of a misunderstanding.”</p>

<p>“Are you not his wife?” he demanded, puzzled
by her smile and sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes; but only in the view of the world,” she
told him, yielding to an impulse, and glad in the
consciousness that this was so. “Even that I
should not have been,” she went on, “but for a
message that bore your name. The will of others
did not prevail. Ah, no! When I became the
wife of Antonio Tarsis it was the will, as I believed,
of Mario Forza.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>

<p>“Hera!” he exclaimed. “Of what message do
you speak?”</p>

<p>“Your despatch from Rome,” she answered,
blissful in the conviction that it was not his.</p>

<p>“I sent no message from Rome. I have never
sent you a message.”</p>

<p>Hera laughed for sheer joy. “Nor did you
receive one from me the night you went away,”
she surmised, seeing the hand of Tarsis in it all.</p>

<p>“Yes; I received a message from you.”</p>

<p>“Ah, where?”</p>

<p>“At Rome. It was handed to me by the
station-master on my arrival.”</p>

<p>“And you made no answer to that?”</p>

<p>“None was required. It had only three words;
but those were enough to make me happy indeed,
for they dispelled all fear that your strength
might fail at the last.”</p>

<p>“And those three words?”</p>

<p>“You said, ‘All is well.’”</p>

<p>“No; it was not that,” she laughed; and with
a gaiety which he understood now, and shared
as well, she told him of the message despatched
at the request of Tarsis, asking what she should
do&mdash;keep or break her engagement of marriage.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
In that moment they forgot the trickery by which
he had gained her hand. Enough to know that
each in spirit had been true to the promise given
and taken in the monastery; that, however great
the disaster to their hopes, the power of their
love had never lessened. She would have told
him more of the events in Villa Barbiondi after
his departure for Rome but for Donna Beatrice,
who came toward them, her face a picture of
vexation.</p>

<p>“His Majesty is expected at any moment,” she
informed Hera, with shaking voice; “and you
with your husband are to be in readiness to
receive him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Aunt,” she answered. “I will go.”</p>

<p>The three walked together across the garden
to the grand portico, up the staircase swarming
with guests, and into the Atlantean chamber,
where Mario took leave of the others. The
company was becoming impatient, for it was
the dinner hour in many houses.</p>

<p>“Something of a change from their coop in
Via Monte Leone,” remarked a certain Nobody-in-particular,
as Hera and her father passed by.</p>

<p>“Yes; and there’s the magic hand that did it,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
observed her companion, with a movement of his
head toward Donna Beatrice, who was approaching
with Tarsis.</p>

<p>“Donna Beatrice! You are right. A noble
fisher maiden.”</p>

<p>“Who hooked a golden whale.”</p>

<p>“She has a carriage not shared with other
branches of the family <i>now</i>.”</p>

<p>“How is that?”</p>

<p>“Family secret. I’m the only outsider who
knows. Some time I may tell&mdash;you.”</p>

<p>“Tarsis looks as if he’d like to bite somebody.”</p>

<p>“Old instinct. You know the beginning of
his career?”</p>

<p>“Yes; watch-dog in a silk-mill.”</p>

<p>“Time-keeper. I suppose that’s the kind of
face he used to pull when a hand turned up late.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he’ll dock the King for arriving after
the whistle has blown.”</p>

<p>“Is there anything that you respect?”</p>

<p>“Nothing but you.”</p>

<p>They laughed and went up to Donna Beatrice
and Tarsis to say pleasant things. An orchestra
of picked players from La Scala made music,
but the hum of talk and the laughter drowned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
all save the <i>fortissimo</i> attacks. Mario and the
Cardinal stood near by that they might hear the
quieter passages.</p>

<p>The Nobodies-in-particular continued:</p>

<p>“Do you know, I have an impression that the
honey in the moon has curdled.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know that honey curdled. Still,
I’ll waive the point. Why do you think
so?”</p>

<p>“Have you detected any sign of sweetness
between them?”</p>

<p>“No; but would you have them bill and coo
in public?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not. Nor would I have them cat
and dog in public.”</p>

<p>“You have a prolific fancy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course. It is natural that you, belonging
to the blind sex, should look straight at them
and see nothing.”</p>

<p>“What was there to see?”</p>

<p>“View one: His melodramatic stare when
she gave Forza her hand. I wonder if Tarsis
knows anything.”</p>

<p>“Let us revel in a thrill of charity and wonder
if there is anything to know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>“You may. I shall continue to use my eyes
and wits.”</p>

<p>“Upon my word, I see nothing sensational in a
man looking at his wife.”</p>

<p>“Modest of you, Reni, and considerate. To the
pure all things are pure. You were too noble to
say it and crush me.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I might have done so, only the
deuced proverb is always taking another shape
in my mind&mdash;to the poor all things are forbidden.”</p>

<p>“Is that the reason our Hera forbid you?”</p>

<p>He coloured, but had to join his laugh with
hers. “I see that the shared carriage is not the
only family secret you are guarding,” he said.
“How many people have you kept this one from?”</p>

<p>“I could answer with one word, but will not.”</p>

<p>“The word ‘all’ or the word ‘none’?”</p>

<p>“Think of being so rich that you can ignore
money!” was her irrelevant response. “I could
tell you what happened to Donna Hera of the
Barbiondi not long ago&mdash;before her marriage&mdash;when
she ordered some things at a certain shop,
but I will not. It’s a family secret. Now she’s
lavishing money on the unfashionable poor.”</p>

<p>“I wish we might go,” he said restively. “I’m<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
hungry. I want my dinner.” He screwed his
fists into his eyes and whined like a schoolboy.</p>

<p>“What a savage that fellow Tarsis is, though!”</p>

<p>“Of course. We are all savages under the
skin. Come and have some champagne on an
empty stomach.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. I’m not savage enough for
that.”</p>

<p>In the banquet hall servants stood with folded
arms about the waiting board. Long ago they
had laid the napery and set the crystal and silver
for six persons&mdash;the King, the Queen, Don Riccardo,
Donna Hera, Donna Beatrice, and Signor
Tarsis. By this hour the reception should have
been over, the guests’ carriages rolling from the
court, and the dinner reaching the period of
<i>poisson</i>.</p>

<p>In the kitchen a great composer beat his temples
and walked the floor frantically. Had not the
symphony been commanded for half-past seven?
And at half-past seven the prelude was ready,
with all the delicious harmonies that were to follow
cooking to such tempo that perfection would
attend their serving. And the wines! The golden
Chablis, the garnet Margaux, and the sparkling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
ruby of Asti, the last by his Majesty so beloved&mdash;all
in the ice, their cooling timed to a minute.
Every second that passed made his symphony
less fit for the palate of gods and dimmed the lustre
of his noble art. Even at this moment the dinner
was a wreck. Magnificent devil! What right
had a king to ruin a masterpiece!</p>

<p>The people in the street called to one another
and made jokes after the manner of a crowd that
has waited long enough to have a sense of acquaintance.
Soldiers held back the multitude on either
side of the Corso, but the space before the palace
gates was kept clear by the Civil Guards. At the
latter now and then was hurled a coarse jibe, to
the delight of many; for the stovepipe hat of
their policemen, the black gloves, and the club
that is like a walking stick never cease to be comic
in the eyes of the Milanese.</p>

<p>La Ferita, the woman of the scarred face, who
shook her fist at Tarsis on his wedding day, was
in the crowd before the palace. She cried out
several times against Tarsis. Once a Civil Guard
pushed her back, with a warning that he would
take her in charge if she did not hold her tongue.</p>

<p>“Arrest the man in there!” she shouted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
pointing toward Palazzo Barbiondi. “He takes
the life-blood of children! He works them to
death in the factories; pays them fifteen <i>soldi</i>
a day! The children die, but he lives on in his
grand house! Who pays for it?” she shrieked,
facing the crowd and waving her upraised arms.
“We do, comrades; we&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>A tirade against his Majesty’s host, within
hearing almost of the distinguished man himself,
was not to be permitted, and, weary of admonishing
her, the Civil Guard lugged La Ferita off to
the Questura.</p>

<p>Tarsis and Donna Beatrice went to a window
and peered up the Corso, but there was no sign
of the royal equipage, no flutter in the crowd to
denote its coming. Although the daylight was
failing, they could still see the city gate and
Sandro in the motor car, stationed there, charged
to bear word as soon as the King and Queen were
sighted, that the host and hostess might have
time to go down to the portico to receive them.
To this part of the function Tarsis had looked
forward eagerly. He had even rehearsed the
scene, going through the act of bowing low to the
Queen and offering her his arm, while in imagination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
his wife, on the King’s arm, led the way up
the staircase.</p>

<p>“I was not prepared to see Mario Forza here,”
Donna Beatrice said to Tarsis, compressing her
lips and patting one hand with her closed fan.</p>

<p>“It is by the King’s wish,” he told her.</p>

<p>“Strange!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” he explained. “A political consideration.
I hope no accident has prevented his
Majesty from coming.”</p>

<p>“It is only that athletic exhibition, I am
positive,” she said. “As he is to distribute the
prizes I suppose he cannot leave graciously until
the bore is at an end. I was at one once. The
waits between the events were the chief feature.
If there is anything that would delight to keep
a king waiting it is an athletic exhibition.”</p>

<p>But Tarsis did not hear. His attention was
held by a dialogue at his shoulders between a man
who leaned against the lintel and one who stood
within the room.</p>

<p>“There are two sorts of women you must not
know,” said the nearer man. “They are the
women who love you and the women who do not.”</p>

<p>“You are right. I know; I have suffered.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>“You make a mistake to suffer,” the first
speaker continued. “If a woman insults you,
bow to her. If she strikes you, protect yourself.
If she deceives you, say nothing for fear of compromising
her. Kill yourself, if you please, but
suffer&mdash;never!”</p>

<p>“To this point I agree with you,” said his
companion: “Some life should pay&mdash;yours, hers
or his.”</p>

<p>The other shrugged his shoulders. “That, of
course, is a matter of taste.”</p>

<p>Tarsis had glanced quickly at the men and
turned his back again. Now he stood staring
into the rain of the fountain in the court below,
his hard face set like stone, preoccupied darkly
with what he had heard. So deep was his absorption
that he failed to hear Donna Beatrice exclaim
that the King was approaching.</p>

<p>“Antonio!” she repeated, rousing him with a
touch on his sleeve. “Come, let us find Hera and
go down to receive his Majesty.”</p>

<p>He looked out over the throngs far up the Corso,
and saw Sandro speeding toward them. In the
quick sweep of his eye he noted too, that the soldiers
at the Venetian Gate were forming in marching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
order, leaving the people free to break their lines
along the street sides. And as he followed
Donna Beatrice from the window he was aware
of a changed note in the murmur of the crowds&mdash;a
note that was not of glad acclaim. In the group
near the orchestra were the Cardinal and Hera
with an arm about her chum of the Brianza, the
little Marchioness of Tramonta, and near them
Don Riccardo and Mario Forza. While they
listened to the music Donna Beatrice and Tarsis
were searching for Hera. Before they came upon
her the motor car was panting in the court and
Sandro had started up the staircase with his
tidings.</p>

<span class="smaller">AN UNBIDDEN GUEST</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> inarticulate voice of the crowd had grown
to a roar and the ominous note Tarsis caught
was now a distinct expression of horror. It rose
above the tittle-chat, the tinkling of wine-glasses,
the laughter and all the clack and fizzle of the
gay assemblage, sending the guests to the windows
and bringing the music to a stop. Hera took the
arm of her husband, and they started for the
staircase. A few steps and they were face to face
with Sandro.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Signore,” he said, his lips
twitching.</p>

<p>“What is it?” Tarsis asked.</p>

<p>“I have to tell you, Signore, that his Majesty
will not be here”&mdash;an odd fling of cynicism,
innocent as it was untimely, born of the servant’s
awe of his master rather than of an instinct to
break the news by degrees.</p>

<p>Tarsis looked as if he would strike the man.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
He moved closer to him, fists clinched at his side.
“What do you mean?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“The King is dead!”</p>

<p>Those within hearing echoed the words, pressing
nearer to Sandro, and from the windows, by which
the news had come from the street, guests swept
toward the group about Tarsis, exclaiming, “The
King is slain!”</p>

<p>Tarsis gripped Sandro’s arm. “Tell what you
know!” he commanded him.</p>

<p>“I know only this, Signore,” he began&mdash;and the
jewelled women and decorated men narrowed the
circle about him: “I got it from a customs
guard at the gate. His Majesty had just started
from the athletic grounds. A young workman
walked up to the carriage and shot him at three
paces.”</p>

<p>“At three paces!” several women repeated,
shocked anew by this detail of the crime.</p>

<p>“What kind of man is the assassin?”</p>

<p>“The guard said he is a silk-weaver and an
anarchist. That was the rumor from Monza.
They have him in charge.”</p>

<p>At the word anarchist, Tarsis, with a quick
movement, turned from Sandro and set his gaze<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
on Mario Forza. The act was so marked that
every eye followed his. Mario returned a steady
look, and for a moment they stood thus, to the
amazement of all.</p>

<p>Electric light flooded the scene, flashing back
from the gems of the women. There was the
hubbub of the crowd in the street, with its hue
and cry. From the gardens the scent of magnolia
came in on the evening breeze. With a shuddering
fear Hera saw the veins of her husband’s neck
strain, as she remembered them in that hour of
wrath in the monastery. He moved a pace closer
to Mario. “Honourable Forza,” he said, his
voice like an edged blade, “the worst has
happened. Are you content?”</p>

<p>The others were mystified, but Mario had an
inkling of what he meant. “Why do you ask
that?” he inquired, striving to be calm.</p>

<p>“Because it is your work!” the other answered,
savagely.</p>

<p>“Do you mean, Signor Tarsis, that I have had
a hand in this assassination?”</p>

<p>“That is precisely what I mean.”</p>

<p>“The assertion is absurd, and it is a lie!” Mario
declared. “I regret that I have to say this to you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
in your own house, but you have forced me to it.”</p>

<p>Tarsis tossed his head and laughed mockingly.
His studied decorum of the gentleman was forgotten,
and he stood forth in the truth of his
native self. A moment he eyed the man he hated
in a vulgar effect of shrewdness, then shook an
index finger sidewise before Mario’s face, as the
Sicilian peasant uses to denote that he is not to be
gammoned.</p>

<p>“Signori,” he began, turning to the astonished
guests at his side, “this man knows how to play
the traitor and at the same time act the innocent.
He and I understand each other excellently.
We shall have no denial from him on that point,
I think,” he added, throwing a glance at his wife.
“There are one or two more here who understand.”</p>

<p>“I thought he knew something,” whispered
Signora Nobody-in-particular to her companion.
“Delicious! He’s going to tell!”</p>

<p>A similar thought must have impelled Mario.
He stepped forward a little, and, with the sole
purpose of saving an insensate husband from
sullying his wife’s name, he spoke to Tarsis, his
tone severe, but not without a shade of entreaty.</p>

<p>“Guard your tongue,” he said. “If you have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
a quarrel with me, this is not the time or place.”</p>

<p>Tarsis faced him, with blazing eyes, his last
vestige of restraint thrown off. “I will be judge
of the time and place to speak!” he exclaimed.
“You know too well what I meant when I said
this is your work. Perhaps there are some here
who do not catch my meaning. You and your
crew of demagogues are to blame for the King’s
death. I charge you with it publicly. You
poison the minds of ignorant people, set the
workers against their betters, teach them to hate
authority, incite them to riot and bloodshed.
I say that you have plotted against the King’s
life, and are just as much the taker of it as the
miscreant who fired the shot.”</p>

<p>It was so different from what he had expected
and dreaded that Mario felt more of relief than
resentment. That Tarsis had omitted Hera’s
name seemed a full requital for the wrong done
him in that reckless accusation. Nevertheless,
he would have replied to it but for the Cardinal,
who raised his hand and invoked peace in the name
of heaven.</p>

<p>“It is hard to hold one’s peace,” Tarsis protested
sullenly, “when such a deed is done, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
the instigator of it stands before one’s eyes under
his own roof.”</p>

<p>Mario was about to leave the palace, but the
Cardinal touched his arm. “Stay a while,” he
said, “and I will go with you.” For a moment
he held Tarsis in the regard of his kindly though
keen eyes, as if studying him. “Much of the
injustice that man does his neighbour is by reason
of his seeing him through the glass but darkly,”
he affirmed, in the manner of one who would dispel
a misunderstanding. “It is not the first time
that the Honourable Forza has been called a
demagogue, but always it has been a calumny.
I, who am his friend and know him, can do no
less than say this. To be a demagogue, I take
it, is to be at war with truth&mdash;to strive for popular
favour by inflaming the selfish passions of men.
I am sure he has not done that. He has wielded
a lance, and an able one, but always it has been
the lance of truth and valour. He has striven
to mellow the world’s hard hopes with even-handed
justice. Wrong is not a mender of wrong. The
sorrow we all feel in this hour and revengeful
passions go ill together. The occasion does not
call for denunciation or abuse of men or doctrines.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
Let us try to find the use there may be in this as
in all adversity. Anarchy has no more determined
foe than Signor Forza. His war is upon offenders
against human justice, and that is the same as
war upon anarchy. No one loves his country
more than he, no one loved the King more.
I know that his public services are in harmony
with the things that we all should hold best&mdash;the
Church, which is of Christ, and Italy, which
is our country.”</p>

<p>In the hush that reigned Mario said, “I thank
your Eminence,” and Hera, silently, breathed
a thanksgiving.</p>

<p>Tarsis had not spoken his last word. His lips
were curving with the sarcastic smile that he
could summon. “I perceive,” he remarked,
“that your Eminence has become an apostate
to the New Democracy.”</p>

<p>The Cardinal made no reply, though he stood
a second or two weighing the words. Then,
with the calmness of one who has schooled himself
to avoid fruitless and painful discussion, he
turned, smiling, to Mario.</p>

<p>“Shall we go, Honourable?” he said, and the
other inclined his head. They gave a parting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
word to Hera, and, bowing to the rest of the company,
moved toward the door. As they passed
nearly all made reverence to the Cardinal. Their
exit proved the signal for a general departure of the
guests, and with scant ceremony the company
began to go its way.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="smaller">AN INDUSTRIAL INCIDENT</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Tarsis</span> gave orders that no bright lights be
shown at the windows and that the palace in
other respects preserve an air of mourning. He
passed the night in the library, writing at his
Napoleonic table, smoking and brooding over the
utter failure of his efforts to break Hera’s determination.
He did not regret the attack he had made
on Mario in the presence of the guests. For the
New Democracy he harboured a deep hatred,
and from a conviction born of this he had linked
the doctrines of that party and Mario’s advocacy
of them with the assassination of the King. It
was easy for him to charge Forza with the loss
of the royal visit, and easier to behold him as
the author of his marital discord. The last fact
clung to his meditations, which lasted into the
morning hours.</p>

<p>Hera, alone in her apartments, thought over
the events of the day. What dwarfed all else
in her consciousness was the discovery that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
Mario’s love had never faltered. In the joy of
this revelation she was able to forget for the
moment the bondage into which she had been
lured by Tarsis, the price she had paid for obeying
an instinct of honour. But in the days that
followed she was reminded of it bitterly.</p>

<p>At first the manner of her husband was such
as to inform her negatively that he was willing
no longer to keep up even a show of compliance.
Next it took on a tenor of positive vexation. If
she had been keenly sensible before that he exerted
himself to win her affection, she was alive now to
his studied resentment. He made no effort to
mask his feelings. On the contrary, he paraded
them resolutely. The details of domestic experience
offered opportunities without number, and
she observed that he seldom neglected them.</p>

<p>He did not conduct his campaign of protest as
a man of finer grain might have done. From open
indifference to her wishes he passed to pronounced
acts of discourtesy. Once, while she was with
her maid dressing for a night at La Scala, he
quitted the palace without warning, and did not
return until long after the curtain had fallen on
the ballet. In the morning he offered an apology,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
but no word of explanation. Every day brought
a new sneer to his lip and to his eye glances of
deepened ill-will. This mood never left him.
She was made to feel it alike at the breakfast
table and when he paid her the parting civilities
of the night.</p>

<p>Though all his approaches to her heart were
foreordained to failure, she had been disposed
to retain a certain spark of respect for him; now
this was extinguished because of the discovery
she had made about the message from Rome.
In its place there burned a detestation of the man
which every hour intensified. She realised that
his was not a character to accept, even to perceive,
that her attitude was, after all, just toward him,
surveying it, as she did, in the light of their
pre-nuptial agreement. Her blame of him, in
consequence, was not so large as her commiseration
of self for having been so weak as to heed other
counsels than those of her heart. With the
feeling that she had wronged herself was compounded
a fear that she had wronged Tarsis
as well.</p>

<p>But the idea of surrender had never crossed
her mind. Reason had no play here; it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
merely the intuitive firmness of a fine and wholesome
soul, for whom real marriage could never
be aught but a profound and moral naturalism;
a loving union between man and woman such as
the name of Mario Forza conjured up, ardent with
a sense of the infinite&mdash;the apotheosis of a hallowed
passion. When the duplicity of Tarsis was laid
bare she had known an impulse to leave his house,
to release herself from an obligation he had
imposed upon her by deceit. But she listened
for the moment to a less selfish voice, and decided
to accept the events of her ill-starred wedding&mdash;to
endure, suffer silently, even stolidly, all that it
should entail. She felt so alone. To her father
she would not go; his was a nature to be relieved
of care, not one to be asked to share it. As to
Aunt Beatrice, try as she did, Hera could not
think of her except as the projector of the trouble,
well meaning as her purpose may have been.</p>

<p>There was only one heart that could give
sympathy, only one fellow-being that called to
her, and to this one she might not go, in his counsel
she might not seek guidance. Nevertheless,
chance brought them together one morning in
the garden of the General Hospital. Every week<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
Hera sent roses there, and it was on Flower Day,
as it had come to be known, that she met Mario
in the director’s office. Soon they found themselves
walking in the garden, he telling of a plan
he had for a hospital where soldiers fallen on the
industrial field might be cared for until restored
for the struggle.</p>

<p>“I come as a student,” he explained. “It is
my second visit this week. The organisation
here has no superior in Europe, and in many
respects we shall take it as our model.”</p>

<p>“In what respect will you not take it?” she
asked, as they passed a broad lawn where pale
men and women sat in the sun.</p>

<p>“In our dealing with such as those,” he answered,
indicating the convalescents.</p>

<p>“They seem to be dealt with kindly,” she
observed. “They look contented.”</p>

<p>“Now, yes. Most of them, you can see, are
persons who in health are accustomed to work,
and not at light employment. They belong to
the class who can rest without starving only
when they fall sick and go to a hospital. Most
of those patients on the lawn are done with the
doctor and the nurse. Time, fresh air, good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
nourishment, and rest are their needs. In a few
days they will be dismissed as cured. The
demand for beds is pressing. Their room in the
wards is wanted. They must go. They will not
be strong enough to do heavy work, the only
kind for which most of them are fitted. If a man
is friendless he has an excellent chance to starve
because the hospital turns him out before he is
well enough to earn a living. No employer wants
a gaunt-visaged convalescent.”</p>

<p>“You would provide for him until he is able
to provide for himself,” she said, comprehendingly.</p>

<p>“Yes. We should not pronounce him cured
until he was strong enough to earn his living.”</p>

<p>They entered an avenue of poplars, on either
side of which stood the rows of isolated wards,
and were alone except for the flitting presence
here and there of a white-jacketed attendant or
a nurse in sombre gown. Mario told her that what
she had made known to him at Palazzo Barbiondi
had lit up his world again. When the news of
the wedding reached him, he said, his thoughts
were black indeed. It was as if the sun had fallen
just as it had begun to fill the east with glory.
The love of her had given him a new heart, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
new mind, new senses. Suddenly all life had been
transfigured with an infinite beauty. It was in
the railway carriage returning to Milan that he
learned of the wedding. He told her of the
change that came over his spirit. Bitterly he
cried out against her and the universal heart.
The rapture that had raised him into heaven
broke and he dropped into the pit of hell. And
so it was until he learned that she was the dupe
of&mdash;the forged message. He was glad for the
warmth of sympathy that then suffused his being.
He saw the cruel facts that had ruled her, the
forces that had driven her to the other’s wish.</p>

<p>“Our temple is in ruins,” he said, filled with
pity for her and himself; “but perhaps it will some
time be rebuilt. It must be!” he declared,
passionately. “This love is a necessity of my
life, and will be so long as life shall endure.”</p>

<p>“But it must be content now,” she warned
him, “to live as does the edelweiss of the Alps&mdash;that
lonely plant which grows amid the snow.”</p>

<p>“But always with a flower ready to bloom
safe and warm in its heart,” he added. And he
told her how hope had come to him the day
before in the ruined monastery, where he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
gone to live again, in its delicious memories, that
hour they passed during the hailstorm.</p>

<p>“The leaves were thick on the eglantine,” he
said, “and the chapel was gay with sunshine and
the voices of birds. All the growing, living things
had entered upon their heritage of joy, and then
it was that the light of a great hope, as if from
prophecy, filled&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She had started a little and admonished him to
silence at sight of a familiar figure in the arched
entrance to the main wards, whither their steps
had led them. It was the large frame, ruddy face,
flaxen hair and beard of Ulrich the Austrian.
The man who had sent Hera the false telegram
stood wide-eyed with astonishment and comprehension
to behold her in the company of Mario
Forza. But he quickly recovered his air of
effusive good nature. With uncovered head
and smiling he approached to greet her.</p>

<p>“I have been through the wards,” said Tarsis’s
most confidential retainer, “and everywhere are
the beautiful flowers your Excellency has given.
Ah! the rooms are filled with their fragrance&mdash;and,”
he added, bowing low, one hand pressed upon
his chest, “with the praises of your Excellency.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span></p>

<p>Wondering that chance should have brought
the man there, and conscious for the first time
that in this walk and converse with Mario
there was aught of indiscretion, and preoccupied
as well with an intuition that the Austrian’s
presence boded a new ill, Hera replied to his
compliments with few words, and she and Mario
passed on.</p>

<p>The meeting, in itself a trivial occurrence, proved
a source of much illumination for the Austrian.
It explained what had puzzled his mind ever since
the night he had performed for Tarsis the service
of sending the message that made Hera listen to
his plea. He had tried in vain to account for
that affair as some ruse in a political game where
his resourceful master had set his skill against
that of the leader of the New Democracy. Now
he divined that a woman&mdash;no other than she who
became his wife&mdash;was the stake that Tarsis had
won. He recalled the words of the telegram, and
felt sure that he had hit the mark.</p>

<p>The Honourable Forza, he reasoned, was a
rival before the marriage, and, plainly, was a rival
still. The thought of intrigue obtruded itself
in his survey of the situation, and, in the light of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
his new knowledge, duty demanded that in this
branch of his master’s affairs he perform another
confidential service. It was only just, he told
himself, that Signor Tarsis, too great a man to
keep a watch on his wife, should know that she
had an interest in the General Hospital that was
not confined to visiting the sick and cheering
their lot with gifts of flowers.</p>

<p>Together Mario and Hera entered a ward for
women, and he was with her still as she moved
through the great sick-room, pausing here and
there for a word to some patient. She told him
that she wished above all to visit a certain little
girl, because it was the last opportunity she would
have to do so. “The doctor says that she will
not be here when I come next week. They cannot
save her. She is only twelve years old, but she
worked in a mill ten hours a day.”</p>

<p>“Was it there she contracted the disease?”
Mario asked.</p>

<p>“The doctors think the bad air of the place did
as much as the work and long hours to break down
her health.”</p>

<p>“Is she alone in the world?”</p>

<p>“No; her mother, also a mill-worker, is alive,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
but she was disabled for a time, and the girl had
to toil for both. In the same mill the mother
met with an accident which left her face
scarred terribly. She is here now with her
daughter. Only yesterday was she let out of
prison.”</p>

<p>Hera indicated a bed a few yards away where
a woman was kneeling in prayer.</p>

<p>“It is a cruel, often-told tale,” Mario said.
“In the days when most of our factories were
built the world had not thought much about the
moral welfare or health of those obliged to work
in them. With our enlightenment about other
things, we have learned that forces for combating
foes of the public health are as important to the
state as the army or navy. New laws are compelling
builders of factories to have a care for the
health of the workers.”</p>

<p>“The laws that the New Democracy has given
the country,” she said, aware that Mario more
than any man in Italy had worked to this end.</p>

<p>“Something has been accomplished,” he told
her, “but the work is only begun. Do you know
what mill this girl worked in?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered, but said no more, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
he understood. In all the Tarsis silk-mills child
labour was employed.</p>

<p>They saw the woman rise from prayer, look
down upon the face of her child, and, with a
shriek that resounded through the ward, bringing
patients up from their pillows and nurses running
to the bedside, fall upon the girl’s body, wailing,
and beseeching the ashen lips to speak.</p>

<p>“Don’t go, Giulia! Don’t leave me! You are
all I have!”</p>

<p>With the others Hera drew near and yielded
to an impulse to speak to the mother so alone in
her grief. The sound of her voice hushed the
woman’s sobbing. She looked into Hera’s face,
heavily at first, then set her gaze more sharply
and passed a hand over her brow like one of
bewildered senses. Another moment and she
sprang to her feet, a malediction on her tongue,
and the scar across her eyelid and cheek glowing
angrily, as it had that day in the Cathedral
square when she shook her fist at Tarsis and his
bride.</p>

<p>“It’s her husband’s work!” La Ferita cried,
pointing her finger at Hera. “He killed my
Giulia. He worked the life out of her in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
factory; gave her fifteen <i>soldi</i> for ten hours, and
when she could toil no more left her to die like a
whelp. And for what? That he might have a
palace for her Excellency, and horses, carriages,
jewels, and servants. Look at the two! There
she, there my Giulia!”</p>

<p>Hera, full of pity, could find no word to speak
to her, and the others in the group about the bed
stood speechless, divided in sympathy between
the great lady so mercilessly arraigned and the
stricken woman malevolent in her sorrow. In
the moment of silence a physician who had been
listening at the girl’s heart arose and nodded his
head. This brought a fresh outburst from La Ferita.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s death! Never fear!” she exclaimed.
“His work was well done, your Excellency!
Well done, friends, neh?”</p>

<p>Mario, who had moved to Hera’s side, touched
her arm. “Let us go,” he said, and as they drew
away La Ferita filled the air with new imprecations
against Tarsis. The doctor and the nurses tried
to calm her, but without avail.</p>

<p>“My day will come!” were the last words of hers
that Hera caught as she passed from the room.
“He shall pay. He killed her. He shall pay!”</p>

<span class="smaller">AN HOUR OF RECKONING</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> days afterward, when Hera and Tarsis
were dining alone, he asked her about the work
she had begun among the poor of the Ticinese
quarter, and she told him that she had subscribed
150,000 liras to a fund to build a settlement there
after the London plan, and that she had been
chosen an officer of the Society of Help, and
intended to take an active part in its service.</p>

<p>“By the way,” he remarked, affecting a manner
of light concern, “I have decided to withdraw
my offer of funds for your charitable enterprises.”</p>

<p>“Have you changed your opinion of the work?”</p>

<p>“No; but I’ve changed my opinion of you,”
he answered, and she saw his cold smile at play.
“Perhaps it is as well you should know,” he
added, “that my eyes have been opened.”</p>

<p>In his mind the tale that Ulrich had carried
about the meeting with Mario at the hospital,
he regarded her narrowly, studying the effect
of his words; she was aware of a note of challenge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
in them; their meaning puzzled her, and she broke
the rule of silence she had observed hitherto
toward his displays of malevolence.</p>

<p>“Your eyes have been opened?” she said.
“May I ask what you have seen?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;have&mdash;seen&mdash;your&mdash;subterfuge!” he responded,
leaning forward and striking the table
with the tip of his forefinger.</p>

<p>“Subterfuge?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and let me tell you that it is not worth
while to continue the masquerade of charity.
I am aware of your secret designs.”</p>

<p>“I do not understand you.”</p>

<p>“My belief is that you do,” he returned,
speaking fast and vehemently, “though you may
make yourself believe that you do not, just as
you delude yourself with the idea that you are
exceptionally noble to wrong me, your husband,
that you may be faithful to another man.”</p>

<p>Hera had risen from the table; it was his first
open blow, and she met it standing. A deep flush
of colour dyed her temples, but she compressed
her lips resolutely, obedient to an instinct which
forbade her to quarrel with him, as it would have
forbidden her to bandy words with the domestic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
who appeared just then with the cordial and
glasses. She moved to the open window and
stood with her back to him. Before her lay the
garden with its stately white urns, the rich foliage
of the trees, and beyond the wall the moonlit
roofs of the workers’ homes, all touched with the
mystery of the night, and Hera, looking out upon
the picture, endeavoured to think clearly; she
tried to pacify her warring emotions, to detach
right from wrong, to stand them far apart, and
with the eye of justice survey each in its naked
proportions. As to what might be the whole
meaning of the suspicions he had expressed she
gave no thought; she contemplated only the cause
of the angry spirit that was roused in him, and
of which she saw herself the author; and for this
her conscience adjudged her guilty.</p>

<p>“The fault is mine,” she said, at length, turning
toward him, sadness in her face. “I have done
you a great wrong. By reason of it I am suffering
more than you can know. I ought never to have
become your wife.”</p>

<p>“Still, it is a wrong that you may redress,”
he returned, more gently, as he paused in his
measured pacing of the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>“No; it is impossible,” she avowed, painfully.</p>

<p>“It is your plain obligation to do so,” he asserted,
his manner harsh again. “What right have you
to accept all that your husband bestows and
give nothing in return?”</p>

<p>She answered him slowly, measuring every
word: “The wrong I did you was in yielding
to your solicitations&mdash;in allowing you to persuade
me to marry you. I should have been stronger.
For the rest, I am giving you all that I promised.
Can you deny this?”</p>

<p>He did not answer the question. Instead, he
swept her with a contemptuous glance. “I
perceive that with all this pretty show of remorse,”
he said, “you are determined to keep up your
defiance of me.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, I am acting in no spirit of defiance,”
she replied. “You must believe that. I tell
you that, in the circumstances, I should deem
myself on a plane with the women of the Galleria
if I became to you what you wish.”</p>

<p>She turned again to the window, and his coarse
laugh sounded in her ears.</p>

<p>“You would have me believe,” she heard him
sneering, as he drew nearer to her, “that you are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
living up to some poetic ideal. At the outset I
was fool enough to swallow that fiction. I
thought that you were merely carrying idealism
to the verge of absurdity, and at that point you
would come to your senses and turn back. I
credited my wife with being honest, you see.”</p>

<p>“Will you spare me these insinuations?” she
said. “I beg of you to speak out.”</p>

<p>“Oh, your counterfeit of lofty virtue is skilful,”
he went on, mocking her manner. “Though a
little cheap at times, on the whole it would
deceive a critic who did not know the truth.
I happen to know the truth, signora.”</p>

<p>Now she faced him with flashing eyes. “Tell
me what you mean!”</p>

<p>He snapped his fingers in her face. “Bah!
Your imperious airs do not fool me. I know
something of the blue blood now. It is like any
other&mdash;has the same passions and gratifies them
in the same way. As a noblewoman you ought
at least to have the courage of your vices.”</p>

<p>She started for the door, but stopped suddenly
and faced him again. “Say what you mean in
direct words or I shall go.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I will be plain!” he flung back, going close<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
to her. “The man by whom you pretend to be
inspired so grandly is simply one who provokes
your appetite more than I do. You have never
given him up. He cannot come to you. That
would destroy the pretty illusion of virtue; so
you go to him. To this end you employ a shrewd
subterfuge. Suddenly you are seized with a
fever of pity for the poor of Milan. You have a
burning desire to feed the hungry, to clothe the
naked. You select the Porta Ticinese quarter
for your field of labour, although the same conditions
prevail not a stone’s throw from this spot,”
and he pointed towards the roofs that showed
above the garden wall.</p>

<p>She had turned her back to him. “Why do
you go to the Porta Ticinese?” he went on.
“You wish plain speech. I answer, then, because
Mario Forza is to be found there in his Co-operative
Society offices. He, too&mdash;snivelling demagogue!&mdash;loves
the poor. That you may go to
him, whom you love, you come to me, whom
you choose to despise, for money!&mdash;that you may
carry on your intrigue under the cloak of charity!
I was blind before, signora, but now&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Stop!” she commanded him, wheeling suddenly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
“What you say is false, madly, monstrously
false!” She rose before him a queenly
young figure, erect and tall. Had it been given
to Tarsis to know he would have perceived in that
moment, as he looked upon her, that his anger
had driven him to a terrible misjudgment. The
poise of her head, the intrepid, direct message
of her eyes, her bearing, so superior to
vulgar graces&mdash;these were her clear ensigns of a
disdain profound for the mean, the low, the
perfidious; but to all this Tarsis was blind, as an
enraged bull is blind to the glories of the sunset.
She turned from him and moved once more toward
the door to the passage that led to her private
apartments; but still the impassioned voice
of Tarsis was at her ear.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t play the grand nobility with me”;
he muttered. “I have been too easy with you,
too eager to serve, to please you. I have been
weak&mdash;I, who was never weak before. But that
is past. I don’t care what you do. Henceforth
I shall be strong. Do you hear? I know my
rights. In Sicily we have a way of spoiling such
games as you have been playing.”</p>

<p>Hera kept moving toward the door, but always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
she felt his breath panting beside her. At the
threshold she turned and paused long enough
to say, her voice issuing without a tremor:</p>

<p>“I repeat that what you have said is false, absolutely
false!”</p>

<p>Then she went her way down the corridor.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In solitude, she put herself face to face with the
situation’s hideous fact. Though wounded to
the depths of her being, she had no impulse to
tears. She felt impelled rather to bitter smiles
for her grim failure in striving to serve two masters&mdash;to
travel any path but that which the heart
pointed. So this was the price of her father’s
peaceful days, her aunt’s triumph over the
bloodhounds of debt, the restoration of a Barbiondi
to the palace of her ancestors! Ah, well,
she would end it now, and she cared not whether
the sequel should be good or ill.</p>

<p>The force of events had awakened in her a
latent Titanic element that lifted her superior
to weak scruple. She was conscious of a marvellous
accession of moral strength. Now she
felt that no barrier might rise high enough to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
baffle her purpose. Fervidly she was thankful
that her spirit had come forth unconquered, and
that, chained though she was to a rock, her soul
could be free. She thought of her father, and
weighed the effect upon his fortunes that parting
from Tarsis might produce, but not for long did
she harbour that consideration; she cast it from
her as she might have dashed a cup of hemlock,
resolved that her life should be poisoned no more
for other people’s good. Come what might, in
this crisis she would honour the heart’s edict.
She had learned somewhat of her great mistake.
It had proved a tree of knowledge, and in eating
of the fruit her moral nature had found itself&mdash;become
well defined and unified&mdash;so that she
stood now as a law unto her own processes.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she retained her sense of justice,
and drew comfort from the fact that her husband
had been the aggressor; that the deceit by which
he had obtained her consent to the marriage, his
rash accusations, his insults, gave her warrant
for quitting his house and ending the mockery
of their relation. It never occurred to her mind
that the situation left any alternative course.
She rang for her maid and directed her to prepare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
for their departure on the morrow, by an early
train. Then she wrote a message to Tarsis,
enclosed the sheet in an envelope, and stood it
against a mirror, to make sure that it should
catch her eye in the morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> ten hours, or at nine o’clock in the morning,
Hera, and her maid, the only servant she had
brought from the Brianza, entered a cab that had
been summoned to the Via Cappuccini gate and
drove to the Central railway station. They took
a train that started at about the hour that Tarsis,
heavy-eyed after a sleepless night, seated himself
at the breakfast table and received her eloquently
brief note. It was placed in his hand by Beppe,
the velvety man-servant who brought the coffee:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">My Husband</span>:
</p>

<p>Your groundless accusations leave me no alternative
but to withdraw from your house. It is my
purpose to make the separation permanent. I go to
my father.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Hera dei Barbiondi.</span></p>
</div>

<p>He read it a second time, then leaned back and
flecked the sheet with his fingers in a studied show
of cool reflection; but his bitten lip spoiled the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
effect that he strove to produce. When he looked
up Beppe’s eyes were riveted upon him in a
manner unheard of for that genius in the art of
seeing and hearing nothing. The incident, small
in itself, proclaimed loudly enough that the
palace retainers, from stable-boy to the head of
the kitchen, were feasting already on the delicious
scandal. It advised Tarsis as well that before
nightfall the fashionable world would have the
news on its tongue, thence to fly from the twelve
gates of Milan to all parts of Italy.</p>

<p>Though contempt for public opinion had marked
his career in all else, he had taken a keen pride
in standing before the world as the husband of
his young and beautiful high-born wife. It was
the dearest of all his triumphs because it fed his
vanity most. And now he perceived the glare
of ridicule into which her desertion must throw
him. Oddly enough, it was this realisation that
set the first brand to his wrath. He was seized
with a wild impulse to follow her to Villa Barbiondi
and assert his authority over her&mdash;compel her,
by main force, if the need should be, to return
to the palace.</p>

<p>When he rose from the table the servant was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
not too busy to take notice that he caught up
the bit of writing and crushed it in his fist. What
step this man of the South would take in the case
at hand was a question of absorbing interest to
the Northern men and maids of the household.
They believed, one and all&mdash;and in hushed
voices uttered their belief as a black forecast&mdash;that
the life of some one would be demanded in
payment of the bill, and that it would not be the
life of their master. Every item of news that
could be carried to the kitchen and stables was
awaited avidly, and Beppe, there on the spot,
knew that many ears yawned for the report of his
observations. Tarsis was aware not only that
the man’s eyes followed him when he moved from
the breakfast room, but that a neck was craned
to keep him in view as he made his way across
the Atlantean chamber.</p>

<p>The splendours of that great room played upon
his feelings with a strange subtlety. He felt the
power for mockery which at certain moments
resides in lifeless things. With its spell upon
him the marble Atlantes began to breathe; their
hollow eyes had the gift of sight, and from their
high stations between the windows they looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
down upon him with cynical interest. He noted
for the first time that all the portraits of the
Barbiondi were painted with a broad grin. The
very walls of the palace chuckled in their re-echo
of his solitary footfalls.</p>

<p>Entering the library, he closed the door and
paced before the printed wisdom of ages; but no
quieting message was there for him in all that
treasury of placid thought, divine inspiration,
human experience. It was as if no Greek had
ever meditated, no Christ ever lived, no fellow-being
ever suffered. In his own life the tragedy
of ages was on for its hour, and the spirit that
swayed him was the spirit of the cave-dweller
robbed of his female in the dawn of the centuries.
The events of the last two weeks rose before him.
A vision of all that had come and gone grew
vivid in his mind. At first Donna Beatrice and
Don Riccardo and Hera were there, each standing
in proper relation to the whole; but one by one
these faded out to disclose with infuriating boldness
the face and figure of Mario Forza.</p>

<p>A few minutes more and Tarsis ceased walking
to take a seat at the Napoleonic table.
He rested one arm on the mosaic and drummed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
meditatively with the tips of his fingers. There was
naught in his bearing now to indicate the storm
through which he had passed. Nor was there any
sign that he had reached a terrible decision.
Again he was the self-centred man of business,
calmly at work upon the details of an important
project. The prophecy of the kitchen and the
stable yard was in the first stage of its realisation.
To Mario Forza the account was to be rendered
and payment demanded in full.</p>

<p>His native impulse was to present the bill in
person, to exact a settlement with his own hand;
it would be no more than the honouring of a law
sacred to his island birthplace. By that method
the honey of revenge was sweetest. Nevertheless,
for a man of his estate its disadvantages were
undeniably real. With a cool head he counted
the possible cost and found it too great. An
ancient Sicilian proverb ran with his thoughts&mdash;“’Tis
easier to shed blood than to wash out its
stains.” Here was a reasoning that appealed
to his mind, accustomed as it was to weigh all in
the balance of profit and loss; and so it fell out
that he shaped a plan of vengeance that should
enlist the service of another. Some one else,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
skilled in the art, but of smaller importance to
himself and the world, should wait upon Signor
Forza and&mdash;present the bill.</p>

<p>So much for the main design; that was clear.
But there were indispensable details, and over
these Tarsis puzzled until he opened his other
hand&mdash;the one not resting on the table&mdash;and
looked at the scrap of paper it had been
clutching. It was Hera’s note crushed into a ball.
A moment he weighed the thing on his open palm
and regarded it in bitter reflection. Here lay
the epitome of his fondest ambition, his capital
disappointment. It was the first and only time
she had written to him; and with the rising of
this fact in his mind flashed an idea that grew
and supplied the details. He dramatised the
future on a stage set with the ruins of a cloister
and an old church for the background; it was a
scene redeemed from total darkness by the glimmer
of a moon that hung far on the slope of the heavens
and there was no sound save the breathing of
him who watched and waited in the shadow, with
a keen blade ready for work. The conception
touched some artistic chord of his nature, and he
smiled and told himself it was good. In the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
monastery Mario Forza had contracted the debt;
in the old monastery he should pay.</p>

<p>He picked open the crumpled paper and spread
it flat on the marble. He smoothed out the creases
as best he could, then got blank paper, a pen,
and a well of ink. It may have been for an hour
that he sat there copying again and again the
few lines his wife had written. In the first
essays his eye travelled often from the copy to the
pen as he fashioned each letter after Hera’s hand
observing minutely and matching the slightest
peculiarity. Patiently he went over and over
the precise curl of a y’s tail, the loop of an l, or
the dot of an i. At length he was able to write
off the missive, Hera’s signature included, to his
satisfaction without once looking at the model.</p>

<p>His next step was to leave the library, locking
the door to make sure that no one should enter
and see the table littered with the evidence of his
work; the next to go to the chamber that was
Hera’s. There he took from a desk some of the
dainty paper and envelopes that bore her monogram.
A few minutes and he was back in the
library making a copy of her note on that paper.
He held the finished product at arm’s length,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
then at closer view, and pronounced it perfect.
He was about to carry this part of his plan to its
fruition by writing a note of his own wording in
the hand of his wife when a knock stayed his
purpose. Instead of calling to the visitor to
enter he rose and opened the door a few inches,
mindful of the scraps on the table. Beppe was
there with a card on his tray.</p>

<p>“Ask Signor Ulrich to wait a few minutes,”
Tarsis said, after glancing at the name. He
appreciated the value of finishing his critical task
while the knack of it was warm in his brain and
fingers. With composure unaffected and care
unrelaxed he wrote the letter that he had shaped
in his mind. It began with “My Beloved Mario”
and closed with the words, “Yours, though all
the world oppose, Hera.” He inscribed the
envelope, “To the Honourable Mario Forza,
17, Via Senato, Milan,” sealed it, and placed it in
an inner pocket of his coat.</p>

<p>Beppe knocked again. “I beg your pardon,
signore,” he began when Tarsis had swung the
door no farther than before; “but the gentleman
is so urgent. He says he must see you&mdash;that he
has news which you ought to have at once. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
seems very full of it, signore,” he added, gravely.
“I am afraid the poor gentleman will explode if
he is not admitted very soon.”</p>

<p>“Ask him to wait another five minutes,”
Tarsis said, and Beppe made off with a submissive
“Very good, signore,” but his head shaking
dubiously.</p>

<p>One by one his master gathered the sheets on
the table into an orderly pile, folded the lot
deliberately, and slipped them into his pocket;
he looked under the table and the chair to be
certain that no trace of his work remained.
Then he lit a cigarette, rang for Beppe, and told
him to show in Signor Ulrich.</p>

<p>The superintendent-general of the Tarsis Silk
Company bustled into the library, his lips puffing,
eyes big with excitement. Tarsis greeted him
standing, waved his hand to a chair, and asked
what had happened.</p>

<p>“Happened!” exclaimed Signor Ulrich. “<i>Per
Dio</i>, I could tell you sooner what has not
happened.”</p>

<p>“Let us have what has happened first,” was
the other’s quiet command. “Be good enough
to give me the facts briefly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p>“Briefly, then,” cried the Austrian, too much
agitated to sit down, “hell is at large!”</p>

<p>“A strike?”</p>

<p>“No; a revolution!”</p>

<p>Tarsis had schooled himself not to take the man
too seriously; he valued the ardour that he gave
to his tasks, but took care to divide the chaff
from the wheat of his enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“What are the particulars?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“All our mills are shut down.”</p>

<p>“All in Milan?”</p>

<p>“In three provinces&mdash;Piedmont, Lombardy, and
Venetia. They called the hands out by telegraph.
But that was only the beginning. The mob is
shouting for bread and rioting; not alone the silk
workers, but hundreds of others&mdash;all the lazy
rabble of the quarter”; and the man of practical
notions fumed in wrath against this unexpected
phase of social phenomena.</p>

<p>“A bread riot is hardly our affair,” Tarsis
remarked, dropping into a chair. “It’s a case
for the police.”</p>

<p>“But they have made it our affair,” Ulrich
said. “Every window in the Ticinese Gate mill
is smashed, and what is more, the place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
would have been in flames but for the carbineers.”</p>

<p>“Are the soldiers out?” Tarsis asked, blowing
the ashes from his cigarette.</p>

<p>“Soldiers out! Horns of the devil! The soldiers
have been attacked, they have discharged
a volley into the crowd, killed two, and wounded
nobody knows how many.”</p>

<p>The Austrian looked in vain for any sign of
alarm on the face of his master. To Tarsis it
seemed a petty incident, indeed, by contrast
with the revolt in his own soul and the deed upon
which he had determined.</p>

<p>“This has happened before,” he said, “and I
have no doubt that order will be restored in a
few hours. Now, let us consider the strike.
That is more to our concern. What do they want
this time?”</p>

<p>“I confess that I do not know and am unable
to ascertain,” Ulrich answered, quelled in a
measure by the other’s belittlement of the situation,
but not convinced.</p>

<p>“Have they presented a demand?”</p>

<p>“No, signore. It came about in this way
at the Ticinese Gate mill: Every Tuesday I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
make a visit of inspection there. I arrived as
usual at 8 o’clock this morning. In the weaving
department I noted a strange, brazen-faced
fellow going from loom to loom distributing
leaflets. I guessed that he was up to some
mischief. Quietly I got a look at one of the
circulars and saw that the rascal was sowing
socialism in our own ground&mdash;under our noses,
in truth.”</p>

<p>“What was in the circular?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it was a seditious, scurrilous, shameful
thing. The heading of it was ‘To the Golden
Geese,’ and it asked them how much longer they
were going to lay golden eggs for Tarsis and his
gang of conspirators against the poor. Tarsis
and his gang! Those were the words, signore!
Anarchism, rank anarchism!”</p>

<p>“And then?” Tarsis asked, glancing up while
Ulrich paused for breath.</p>

<p>“I had the fellow arrested, of course. But not
a word of protest had I uttered before. Ha!
They all thought I was afraid to speak. While he
was distributing the papers I telephoned to the
Questura of Police. Quickly two Civil Guards
came and nabbed him. Then what happened?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
Red Errico, foreman of a group of the weavers,
began to cry out against me. He called me a
slave, a tyrant, a jackal, all in the same breath.
Think of it, signore. What ingratitude! You
yourself will remember that it was I who appeared
before the Board of Directors and asked that the
wages of the children be advanced from twelve
to fifteen <i>soldi</i> a day. And now they call me tyrant!
The whole crew of them did it, and to my
teeth, signore, to my teeth!”</p>

<p>“And then?” asked Tarsis.</p>

<p>“The ringleader and the men near him began
squawking like geese and hissing. The whole room
took it up. Red Errico started a cry of ‘No
more golden eggs for Tarsis and his gang!’ and
joining in this every man left his loom and made
for the door. Most of them did not wait to stop
their machines. They rushed down-stairs and at
each floor called to the others to follow. Every
man, woman, and child of them ran pell-mell into
the yard as if the mill were on fire. All the time
they hissed and shouted, ‘No more golden eggs!’
The rabble of the quarter came up, joined the
strikers, and before I knew it every window
was smashed. It was a taste of what we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
may expect from that man Forza’s preaching.”</p>

<p>Signor Ulrich perceived, not without a feeling
of triumph, that his recital had moved Tarsis at last.</p>

<p>“I have heard enough!” he exclaimed, springing
to his feet. “The Government is to blame. It
has been too soft with these Parliamentary
mischief-makers. As to the strike,” he went on,
“come to me to-morrow, and I shall have some
plan. Should the unions send a committee
meantime, refuse them audience. Until to-morrow,
then, Signor Ulrich.”</p>

<p>But the Austrian did not take himself off.
“I beg your pardon,” he ventured, “but I cannot
go without giving you a word of warning. There
is great danger. I beg you not to expose yourself
to it.”</p>

<p>“What would you have me do, my friend?
Go into hiding?”</p>

<p>“No; and still&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Bah! I am not afraid.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, signore, if you had heard what
I heard. Oh, the way they cried out against
you! Believe me, their passions are roused, and
there is no telling what a mob may do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>“It is considerate of you,” said Tarsis, “but
I think I know how to take care of myself. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye, sir; and again I beg of you not to
expose yourself until after order is restored.”</p>

<p>That the superintendent’s admonition was not
wasted appeared when he had gone from the room.
Tarsis paced the floor awhile, striving for some
way to enter the furnace without getting burnt.
To the quarter of the Ticinese Gate he was resolved
to go to-night at whatsoever cost.</p>

<p>If it were possible to sharpen his thirst for the
blood of Mario Forza the turn of events, as narrated
by the Austrian, had done the work. He
felt that he could not compose himself to sleep
again until a decisive step had been taken. As
usual, his thinking bore fruit in definite ways
and means; and in three hours, when the street
lamps were lit, the master of the palace watched
his chance and stole out by the Via Cappuccini
gate. He had clipped his beard; instead of a
white collar he wore a dark silk muffler; his hat was
a broad-brimmed one of felt, and a pair of coloured
goggles concealed his eyes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="smaller">HUNTING THE PANTHER</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">By</span> threading one crooked back street and
another he came out behind the Cathedral, upon
whose southern wall and forest of spires a moon
almost round poured its light. That he might
keep in the shadow of the great Gothic pile he
went to the northern side and walked there. The
organ was pealing for even-song, and its strains
floated out sublimely as he passed the transept
door. He reflected that the last time he had
heard those tones they sounded for his wedding
march; and, his impulse to square accounts with
Mario Forza quickened, he struck across the
square at faster pace.</p>

<p>To the bright Victor Emanuel Gallery, its
throng of promenaders, or the laughing, talking
men and women at the outdoor tables of the
cafés, he gave no heed. The news of the day&mdash;set
forth in the journals hysterically&mdash;was not
taken with much seriousness in that company.
The conflict of the morning, in Milan, between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
the workers and the soldiers was no worse in its
result of killed and wounded than like conflicts
in other towns of the kingdom that day and
the day before. All of the newspapers appreciated
the importance of what had befallen;
a small number were sensitive of the danger
that seemed to be in the air. An alarmist editor
declared that from one end of the Peninsula to
the other the word had passed to revolutionary
centres to rise against the Government.</p>

<p>The trouble was due chiefly to the dearness of
bread. In the country districts it was aggravated
by the strike of the agricultural labourers. Tuscany
and Sicily, Naples and Romagna were
seething with discontent. Parma, Piacenza, and
Pavia in the North, Arcoli, Malpetra, and Chieti
in the South, had been scenes of bloodshed.
Nevertheless, in the luxurious harbours of life
there was a tendency to discredit the journals,
to judge them over-zealous in the concocting of
a sensation.</p>

<p>Tarsis gained the busy highway that leads
toward Porta Ticinese. Passing a man he knew,
he looked at him squarely to test the efficacy of
his disguise; the other gave no sign of recognition,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
and he went on with renewed confidence. He
was aware that the Milanese carried themselves
with an odd mien to-night. There was a certain
anxiety in the faces of some, notably the better-dressed
class. Those who belonged to what is
called the lower populace had a saucy, lightly
defiant air; they walked with a swagger and
stared the better-dressed out of countenance;
some of the young men had in their gait the swing
acquired by service in a regiment of Bersaglieri,
but when they passed a conscript from the
barracks they made sport of him.</p>

<p>Tarsis’s course lay past the Chapel of Santa
Maria delle Grazie, where the <i>Last Supper</i> of
Leonardo da Vinci survives. Thence, by one or
two turnings, he reached the Corso Porta Ticinese.
Never had he seen that thoroughfare, always
teeming with life, so crowded. The people
swarmed in from all directions and overran the
sidewalks. He encountered groups of workmen
singing labour songs or listening to heated oratory
which was a confusion of old prejudice and new
thought.</p>

<p>A little farther and he was in the heart of the
quarter. There were now no vistas of gardens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
through arched porticos. Here and there a
withering flower on a window ledge struggled
for life. The champion of vested interests was
vaguely sensible of a sneer in the air&mdash;an impalpable
ghost that grinned at stock ideas. A dead
cat whizzed from somewhere and struck a passing
carbineer, who looked back with a curse, which
the men returned in kind and the women with
hisses. In a café that had a marionette show a
drama was under way. It was called <i>The Man
and the Master</i>. Every time the Man belaboured
the Master with a club&mdash;which was very often&mdash;the
bravos of the audience were loud and long.</p>

<p>Tarsis was seeing the social picture at close
range, but it did not give him a new appreciation.
His mind was not receptive that night. He had
not entered poverty’s region for observation and
study, but to seek out the one human creature
in the world to whom he was willing to intrust
the task of exacting payment from Mario Forza.
For the time being his whole existence was centred
upon that design.</p>

<p>He came to the old octagonal church of San
Lorenzo. From a pulpit outside a priest was
preaching the gospel of peace. Most of the auditors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
were bare-headed women, whose faces, as they
listened, were blank; some of them wore a look of
dull scepticalness. On the skirts of the assemblage
younger persons larked among themselves or
scoffed in an undertone at what the priest said&mdash;an
irreverence that did not seem to grate upon
anybody’s sensibilities. At times the preacher’s
voice was drowned by the <i>Marseillaise</i> coming
in mighty chorus from a tavern. When a bag
on the end of a long pole wielded by a brawny-armed
sacristan was passed among the congregation
the coppers chinked, as of old, to the
honour of the Lombardian proverb, “The hand
of the poor is the purse of God.”</p>

<p>News-sellers shouted the name of a revolutionary
journal. In big headlines the revolt of the
silk workers was heralded and the military
berated for shooting down the window-smashers.
The papers were so held in the arms of the vendors
that Tarsis saw the cartoon that had been
dashed off and published on his wedding day.
The editor “had judged the events of the morning
a fit reason for recalling it to patriotic use, as the
Minister of War had recalled some of his
reserves to service.” Wherever Tarsis looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
he beheld his punched nose and the flow of gold
pieces.</p>

<p>Beyond the church, serene in the moonlight,
as if a spirit of the eternal chiding men for their
vain turmoil, rose the ancient colonnade of San
Lorenzo, the only large fragment of her remote
past that Milan possesses. The great Corinthian
columns had stood there since the third century,
when “Mediolanum,” second only to Rome, was
affluent in the dignity and beauty of an imperial
city. An orator of the quarter, sowing discontent,
once made use of the noble relic to point a moral.
“There are two sorts of ruins, my comrades,”
he said; “one is the work of time, the other of
men.”</p>

<p>The place for which Tarsis was making lay a
little farther on. It was a café of the cheap and
gaudy grade; its large front windows bore the
legend in yellow and green, “Café of the Ancient
Colonnade.” Before he could traverse the Corso
there swung into view from another street a
vociferous collection of men and women marching
without order of line. They were the striking
silk-workers. Tarsis had no taste for breaking
through their ranks, which he must have done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
to reach the point upon which he had his eye.
He waited until they had gone by.</p>

<p>They made a great hubbub with their songs
and outcries against facts of the existing order.
At their head a blacksmith bore a huge banner
inscribed “Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Men and Women.” Scattered through the
jumbled mass of marchers were placards bearing
such declarations as:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“We are the golden geese.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“We want more of the golden eggs.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Down with the tax on bread.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Down with Tarsis and his gang.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>From windows and sidewalk the onlookers
filled the air with their shouts of “Bravo!” Now
and then a group of them would join the marchers.
One placard read, “We Are the Heart-blood of
Wealth,” but to Tarsis the demonstration did
not seem a pulse-beat of society; in his view it was
merely another howl from the ungrateful proletariat.
He was annoyed because he had to wait
and indignant that the authorities did not put
a stop to the incendiary display. In due course
it was broken up by the carbineers&mdash;<i>ultima ratio<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
legis</i>. Grape shot was scattered freely, undertakers
enjoyed a revival of trade, and the wards
of the General Hospital were over-crowded. Tarsis
heard the firing from a distance, and thought
it high time the authorities took the case in hand.
The last of the marching mob had passed before
that act of the drama was played, leaving him
free to cross to the Café of the Ancient Colonnade.</p>

<p>He saw the Panther&mdash;the man he sought&mdash;seated
at a table by the window engrossed in a game of
<i>mora</i>. While he had faith enough in his disguise
as an outdoor device, he was unwilling to tempt
fate by entering the café. It was possible, he
reflected, that one of the rough fellows there,
playful in his cups, might pull the goggles from
his eyes. That the sound of his voice alone
would be sufficient to make the one he wanted
recognise him he felt sure, but it might reveal
his identity to others as well. So he walked on,
to return again and again. For two hours he
passed and repassed the place, striving to catch
the eye of his man and give the signal that would
not fail to bring him forth. When at last his
perseverance bore fruit, the fellow who came out
did not look suitable for the employment that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
Tarsis had to offer. He was small of stature and
of sickly mien. His eyes were those of a fish,
but he moved with the tread of a panther. Tarsis
kept on walking, and the other followed at a
discreet distance. In that order they proceeded
amid the throngs of the corsos and in the streets
so quiet that they caught the sound of each
other’s footfalls.</p>

<p>So certain was Tarsis of the Panther that he
did not once glance behind. Before he turned
to speak to him they had crossed Via Pier Capponi,
the last illuminated street, and were beyond the
roofs of the town standing in the great level
plain of Army square. There was no mincing
matters. In the Sicilian patter, which was the
mother tongue of each, Tarsis unfolded his
scheme. The wind had blown an opaque shade
over the moon and stars. To the northward,
where the long line of barrack buildings stood,
they could discern lights flitting to and fro and
the shadowy movements of men. They hushed
their voices once or twice when there came out
of the blackness near by the tramp of manœuvring
soldiers, the clank of arms, the low-keyed
commands of the officers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span></p>

<p>When the affair had been arranged, to the
smallest detail, the Panther closed his paw on a
thousand-lira note and vanished in the darkness.
Tarsis waited a minute before he made off; then
took a path around by the cavalry barracks, and
came into the light of the street lamps behind the
Dal Verme Theatre. There he found a cabman
dozing on his seat. He roused him and named
a certain wine-shop hard by the Monforte Gate
beyond the walls.</p>

<p>“Don’t drive across the city,” he said.</p>

<p>“How then, signore?”</p>

<p>“Go by the Girdle Road. I wish to have a
drive.”</p>

<p>“As the signore desires,” said the other,
clucking to his nag.</p>

<p>Soon they were moving in the wide thoroughfare
that girts Milan without the ramparts. The
night was far spent, but men and women kept
it alive in the taverns that clustered about the
Ticinese and other gates that they passed. Tarsis
had no intention of visiting the wine-shop, and
when the cabman had set him down there he
tossed him his fare and walked away. Entering
the city at once, he followed the Bastion drive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
as far as Via Cappuccini, and by this reached the
rear gates of Palazzo Barbiondi. Before stopping
to press the electric button concealed in the iron-work
he took off the goggles, turned up the brim
of his hat, and removed the muffler. Beppe
answered the summons, rubbing his eyes. He
was about to close the small opening he had made
to admit his master when Tarsis commanded him
to throw wide both the gates. The astonished
retainer obeyed, and wondered what new sensation
was brewing. Presently he saw two streams
of light shoot from the garage, then the swiftest
of the motor cars with the master at the lever.</p>

<p>“I will return in an hour,” he said, rolling into
Via Cappuccini. Quickly he was beyond the
walls on the highway that he had travelled often
in his visits to the Brianza. The moon hung low,
but the road was all his own, and he let his machine
go. When he stopped it was before the post-office
in Castel-Minore. The village was asleep
and the post-office was dark; but Tarsis knew
of the iron box set in the wall, with its slot for
letters, and, assured that no eye beheld him, he
drew from a pocket the forgery he had prepared
with such patience and skill. A moment he held<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
it in the light of the motor car’s lamps to make
certain that it was no other than the missive
addressed to Mario Forza; then he went to the
box and dropped it in. The hour which he told
Beppe he would consume had not elapsed when
he was back in Via Cappuccini touching the secret
button at the palace gate.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE POT BOILS OVER</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following day at dawn La Ferita and forty
thousand fellow mill and factory hands broke
the time-honoured rule of their lives. Instead
of going to the work that awaited them, they
joined the battalions of the unemployed and set
about the business of redressing their wrongs.
They adopted the extraordinary course of throwing
up barricades and taking possession of half
of the town. To Ulrich the Austrian and masters
of labour in general this boiling over of the social
pot was a puzzle. And the municipal authorities
were astonished that so many thousands of the
people should follow the banner of anarchy; that
men and women, hundreds of them, should stand
their ground and die when cavalry charged the
barricades. The military officers could not comprehend
it at all, but agreed, over their cognac in
the cafés, that such heroism was worthy of the
conventional battle-field.</p>

<p>Mario Forza and his party in the Camera had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
striven to avert the disaster, but always the
Government had been deaf to the warning.
Why workers should cease work and wish to upset
the established order was as much a riddle to the
cabinet as to the shop-keeper and the manufacturer.
The editor of the newspaper that
printed the famous “punched nose” of Tarsis
was asked what he thought of the situation.
He defined it as a mixture of labour war and
hunger begotten of incompetent, unenlightened
government.</p>

<p>At one gate the troops&mdash;most of them country
lads&mdash;had to fight thousands of peasants armed
with pitchforks and scythes who tried to re-enforce
the rebels within the walls. Cavalry rushes and
volleys from the infantry were used against them,
but their barricades did not fall until cannon was
discharged into them. Many of the rioters had
had more experience as soldiers than the uniformed
farm hands against whom they fought; a condition
difficult to avoid in a country where military
service is the price of citizenship.</p>

<p>On an outer boulevard a large body of insurgents,
after a company of Bersaglieri had given them a
peppering from their muskets, advanced on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
soldiers and showed them what could be done
with stones flung by enthusiasts. They drove
the soldiers into the moat that runs round the
city wall, then returned to the barricades they
were building of overturned carts and carriages of
the gentry and an automobile they had captured.</p>

<p>Every one arrested was heard before a court
martial; all prisoners were committed to cells.
From behind their bars they launched curses
against their captors and defiance of authority.
Some of the newspapers hailed the
uprising as the birth of a new and glorious Italy.
These were seized promptly. Men with swords
sat at the desks where men with pens had done
their work. The Queen of Holland, who was
expected, was advised by the Minister of the
Interior not to proceed to Milan. Wherever
workmen were found grouped an unceremonious
shower of bullets dispersed them.</p>

<p>It had been all fun for the rebels the night
before, when Tarsis and the Panther, in the gloom
of Piazza dell’ Armi, arranged to square the
account against Mario Forza. There were not
enough soldiers about then to interfere with the
mobs that took the ordering of pleasures into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
their own hands. They swept into the Dal Verme
Theatre and occupied excellent seats. The manager,
wise in his hour, accepted the situation and
instructed his singers to do their best. It turned
out as he expected. Listening to the arias of
<i>The Huguenots</i> proved tame work for revolutionists,
and before the act was over they rushed
into the street, following a leader who had shouted,
in a voice heard above the music, “On to the
bakeries, comrades! On to the meat-shops!”</p>

<p>The same cry had begun to ring in every part
of the town where the revolt was in progress. It
was an epitome of the new movement. After
all, the reform chiefly desired was a full stomach
instead of an empty one. Bakery windows were
broken, haunches of meat were lifted from their
hooks, slaughter-houses were sacked of dripping
carcasses. Bread! It was piled up at the street
corners! A new type of butcher presided over
the meat. He gave it for the asking and used
no scales.</p>

<p>All this was pleasing and satisfactory to the
Panther, who witnessed such scenes of the drama
as were enacted in the neighbourhood of the
Café of the Ancient Colonnade. It seemed to him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
that affairs had taken a distinctly lucky turn, in
view of the service Tarsis had engaged him to
perform. As he sipped his coffee or puffed his
“Cavour” he reflected that the minds of the
officials, press, and public were preoccupied by
doings of great moment. Therefore, they would
have scant attention to spare on the result of the
small commission intrusted to his skill. In this
carnival of bloodshed and pillage who would
care whether the Honourable Mario Forza were
alive or dead? He had no misgiving, but it was
pleasant to feel that in case his work were done
awkwardly the police would be too busy to meddle
with his business of escape.</p>

<p>“Easy money, and more to come,” he told
himself, complacently, and the hand in his pocket
touched the thousand-lira note that had been
transferred from the wallet of Tarsis.</p>

<p>In other cities there had been similar risings, and
the rulers, appalled by the power of the people
to help themselves, decided suddenly to give
them the measures of relief that Mario Forza and
his Parliamentary group had been asking for
months. The General Government issued a decree
suspending the entire duty on wheat; the municipal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
authorities of Milan put forth a proclamation
saying that the price of bread would be reduced
at the public expense. But the concessions were
too late. Not by bread alone was the madness
to be appeased. The fire of insurrection had
entered the blood, and the masses went on with
their object lesson in the science of bettering
social conditions. Refused the reasonable, they
demanded the unreasonable.</p>

<p>Emblems of refinement and luxury enraged
them. A blind fury which none could foresee
attacked the statues in the public squares, the
ornaments on the fountains, the treasure houses
of painting, sculpture, and letters. A few who
loved and revered such things risked their lives
to save them.</p>

<p>Ulrich the Austrian, on his way to Palazzo
Barbiondi to learn how it fared with his master,
saw and heard things that took the high colour
from his cheeks and made him continue his
journey with the cab-shade drawn. He had seen
women place their children on the top of barricades,
bare their breasts to musket fire, and invite
death. Once above the wave of the mob’s rage
he had heard the tremulous cry of a child; a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
mother, in the front rank of the rebels, was holding
it at arms’ length while the cavalry dashed upon
her. And he had seen women, when struck,
bandage their wounds and return to the battle.</p>

<p>Wherever the mob fought most savagely there
was La Ferita, the long scar on her face dulled
now by the grime of the struggle. Often it
was her hand that applied the torch. With the
women that followed her she urged on the men,
or dashed alone in front of the soldiers, calling
them cowards, assassins, “slaves of Tarsis, who
killed little children.” Now and then the soldiers
charged their tormentors. Although some of
them stood their ground or were carried away
wounded, La Ferita was never among the number.</p>

<p>“I can die!” she told her comrades. “But it
is not time. I have work to do.”</p>

<p>In Via Torino she led her women to a roof,
from which they poured such a destructive fire
on the troops that they had to retire for shelter.
This was achieved without other weapons than
bits of terra cotta, and by a form of attack not
set down in any manual of war. The women tore
up the tiles and chimney pots and dropped them
on the heads of the soldiers. A little while and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
women lay dead on those roofs. An officer of the
military, tired of seeing his men felled, stationed
sharpshooters on other roofs to pick them off.
But even from this danger La Ferita escaped
unharmed.</p>

<p>Inured to long hours of toil, the day of battling
had told little upon her strength, and the deed
of vengeance her mind was set upon spurred her
forward. Then there was the <i>grappa</i>, that
fiery liquor dear to the Milanese workman. It
was as free as the bread and the meat to-day,
and La Ferita did not miss her share. In Via
Torino she fell in with a part of the mob that was
sweeping toward the Cathedral. Vainly she
strove to lead them on to Palazzo Barbiondi,
but they lacked courage to hurl themselves
against the wall of men and horses that reached
across the square.</p>

<p>Yet they drew nearer by inches, until their
irregular front had pressed beyond Via Silvio
Pellico, closing that entrance to the square and
blocking its traffic. The carriage of the Cardinal
of Milan, conveying his Eminence to the railway
station, happened to be one of the vehicles stopped,
and a footfarer unable to proceed for the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
reason was Mario Forza. From his carriage
window the Cardinal hailed Mario. It was their
first meeting since the day in Palazzo Barbiondi
when Tarsis blamed the leader of the New Democracy
for the assassination of the King. Together
they looked on while the legions of lawless
force, fired with passion, approached the cool
champions of constituted power, reviling them
the while and provoking a reply by such irritants
as stones and bottles often well aimed.</p>

<p>Presently the reply was delivered. A bugle
blast, and the line of cavalry dashed forward.
La Ferita, instead of joining the stampede of
her comrades, kept to the tactics she had employed
so successfully in the face of other cavalry charges.
She ran toward the right flank of the onrushing
troopers, thinking to gain the shelter of the portico
of Victor Emanuel Gallery where it ends at Via
Silvio Pellico. She would have succeeded this
time but for that last glass of <i>grappa</i>, gulped
down after her escape from the sharpshooters
on the roofs.</p>

<p>A few feet from the intended refuge she stumbled
and fell at full length. The thunder of hoofs
and the clank of arms were loud above her head;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
but in the next moment Mario Forza had her
in his arms, the cavalcade was flying by, and
she stood safe under the portico. She never
knew who saved her, nor did she care; enough
for her that she had cheated the soldiers once
more, and she shook her fist after them and
cursed them as they went on with their task of
driving the mob from the square.</p>

<p>Nor was Mario aware that the woman he had
saved was she who cried out so bitterly against
Tarsis in the hospital. Although she came out
of the incident unscathed, her rescuer had not
fared so well. The dangling scabbard of the last
trooper of the file struck him a glancing blow,
but one that dazed his senses and brought from
his forehead a crimson stream. When full consciousness
returned he found himself in the
Cardinal’s carriage, which had come to a standstill
in the square before La Scala Theatre.</p>

<p>With a handkerchief the Cardinal had done
what he could to bandage Mario’s wound. “It
is only a little one,” he told him, “but we shall
look to it.” He had ordered the coachman to
drive to the convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie.
“A few minutes, Honourable,” he said, “and our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
friends the Bernardines will stanch that flow of
blood and make you more comfortable.”</p>

<p>“The Bernardines?” Mario repeated. “They
are in Corso Magenta, and your Eminence was
bound for the railway station, in the opposite
direction.”</p>

<p>“Never fear,” the other returned, cheerfully.
“The trains for Como or anywhere else are not
departing or arriving on the mark to-day, and
if I miss one I shall take another. Ah, what have
we here?”</p>

<p>The way was blocked again. A detachment
of the mob which took the soldiers unawares
and succeeded in gaining the square had attempted
to pull down the statue of Leonardo da Vinci.
The rope was ready, but before they could throw
it over the figure and haul it from the pedestal a
battalion of infantry had arrived at double quick.
As the insurgents retreated up Via Manzoni they
filled the air with shouts of defiance, mingled
with a hideous uproar of mocking laughter. It
was the laughter of those who had taken up the
cry, “On to the Supper! Down with the Supper!”</p>

<p>The words came distinctly enough to the ears
of Mario and the Cardinal, in spite of the din all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
about, but they did not attach to them the meaning
of the grinning mob. Had they grasped the
purpose expressed in that grim cry they would
have been keener to reach the Bernardine community
to which they were bound, and for a more
potent reason than that of caring for the wound
of Mario Forza. For centuries the refectory of
the convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie had held
the painting by which the world knows Leonardo
da Vinci best&mdash;his <i>Last Supper</i>. It had
survived the periods of desecration begun by
the monks themselves and ended by the French
soldiers in 1796, under command of the general
whose gift to the House of Barbiondi&mdash;the
Napoleonic table&mdash;Tarsis prized so highly. The
picture must have been lost but for the devoted
service of other painters, who, with reverent
hands, from age to age, brought back its beauty
of form and colour. Now the monks were its
guardians; and now it was a frenzied populace
that would desecrate it&mdash;not in the old way, by
neglect or rough usage, but by tearing it out
of the wall and putting an end forever to the
restorations.</p>

<p>Via Alberto was clear again, and the carriage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
moved forward, while the voice of the destroyers,
growing fainter, sounded as a hoarse murmur
behind La Scala Theatre. In Piazza Mercanti
hands used to far heavier tasks laid hold of the
horses’ heads and stopped the vehicle with a jerk
that threw the Cardinal and Mario from their
seats. The doors were flung open and jeering
men and women surged about them.</p>

<p>“Make the gentlemen walk!”</p>

<p>“To the barricade with the carriage!”</p>

<p>“Come, let us see you use your legs!”</p>

<p>And the gentlemen would have walked but for
the timely recognition of Mario by one of the
masters of the situation. “Back, comrades!”
he cried to them. “It is Mario Forza, the friend
of labour.”</p>

<p>Quickly the horses were released, and the
carriage rolled on amid “Vivas!” for the Honourable
Forza. Without mishap Corso Magenta
was attained, and they drew up at the portal of
the convent. The chubby face and mournful
eyes of Brother Sebastiano greeted the Cardinal,
and the iron-bound door swung wide to him.
Swift were the movements of the brothers when
they realised what had occurred. Not only his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
Eminence under their roof, but with him the
Honourable Forza, wounded and in need of succour!
Suddenly the calm of the place was changed to
bustling activity. Two of the brothers lugged
a cot into a large high-ceiled room where sunshine
entered, and the prior Sebastiano sent others
here and there for liniment, water, lint for the
bandage, and a flask of brandy.</p>

<p>“You have placed me in good hands,” Mario
said to the Cardinal from the cot on which he
reclined; “and I beg of you to retard your journey
no longer. Here you may leave me and have no
anxiety.”</p>

<p>“Of that I am certain,” the Cardinal agreed,
with a nod of confidence to Brother Sebastiano.
“Therefore I shall try for that train.” He looked
at his watch. “Twenty minutes after the hour.
That the delays to-day are of long duration is my
hope; a forlorn one, yet I’ll pursue it, for to Como
I must go.”</p>

<p>Brother Sebastiano and his fellows held up their
hands in dismay. Passion was rioting without,
but on their side of the convent walls they knew
a sense of security, as if the turmoil of the world,
which had turned humanity back to the instincts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
of the jungle, was far away. They shuddered
at the thought that violent hands might be laid
on the Cardinal. Heaven would not permit it,
but suppose&mdash;suppose his Eminence should receive
a black eye!</p>

<p>“Travelling to-day within the city walls or
without,” Brother Sebastiano ventured to admonish
him, “is a most perilous undertaking.”</p>

<p>“Difficult we have found it,” the Cardinal
owned, “but hardly perilous.”</p>

<p>There was a low murmur of respectful dissent
from the monks. “Perilous, too, for the body,
we can assure your Eminence. Ah, what if
harm should befall you!”</p>

<p>“Allay your fear, my dear brothers,” the other
said, lightly, with an assuring smile. “Suppose
they do take my carriage? I can call a cab.
Failing there I can walk. The problem, you see,
is exceedingly simple. As to harm corporeal&mdash;come,
now, why should the people harm me?
To my knowledge I have not harmed them.”</p>

<p>“True, true,” Brother Sebastiano hastened
to assent. “And yet, if your Eminence will
pardon, there is our Brother Ignazio. He, too,
did them no harm; but look at his eye!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span></p>

<p>Brother Ignazio had just entered the room,
carrying a vessel of water. One of his eyelids
and the flesh above and below were of deep violet
shading down to sickly yellow.</p>

<p>“Alas, your Eminence,” he sighed, “those
whom we would serve raised their hand against
me. It happened this morning in the Corso at
our gate, after the service of tierce. As I turned
the corner they fell upon me. They pulled my
hair, my ears and&mdash;my nose. But, with no
bitterness in my soul, I passed on. Then, without
warning, as I was about to enter here, one of them
ran up and gave me&mdash;this.” He pointed to his
discoloured eye.</p>

<p>The Cardinal admitted that the evidence was
conclusive. In his offering of consolation to
Brother Ignazio he told him that the spirit abroad
to-day was no respecter of persons.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless,” he added, “I shall go to Como
if I can get a train. Addio, Honourable,” he
said, going up to the cot, where the brothers
were busy with their patient. “If the railway
is impossible I will return. In any event, my
friend, I will send the carriage to take you to
Via Senato.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>

<p>The prior and all the monks not in immediate
service to Mario accompanied the visitor to the
door, and they gave a concurrent sigh of anxiety
as his carriage rolled away. A little while and
their patient, his wound dressed, was sitting up
and telling them how it happened. He had
reached the point in the narrative where La
Ferita fell and the cavalry was rushing on, when
his ear caught a familiar, ominous murmur and
he paused. It was the voice of the mob as he
had heard it last rising from behind La Scala.
Only now it grew louder. All at once it
burst forth like a fury that had broken bounds,
and coming in by the open windows filled the
convent in every part. And above the roar and
mocking laughter Mario heard again the cry,
“Down with the Supper!” Now he understood
its import, and the white faces of the brothers
told that they too comprehended the jest of the
savage throng.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mario</span> sprang from the couch and asked the
brothers the way to the refectory&mdash;a small building
on the Corso Magenta side of the convent’s domain
separated by tortuous passages and a courtyard
from the rest of the structure. It was on the
southern wall of this humble edifice that Leonardo
painted the Nazarene and the Twelve at table.
Here the picture had spoken to the Milanese four
hundred years ago, and here, for all who wished
to look, it told still the story of the hour before
Gethsemane. By long custom the Bernardines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
had thrown the place open every day at a certain
hour; but Brother Sebastiano, in the light of
Brother Ignazio’s black eye, had decided to
break the rule to-day. Thus it fell out that when
the frenzied reformers of society reached the gate
to the arched passage on which the refectory
opened they found it locked and bolted and
barred. That was a condition calling for the use
of axes, and it was the sound of these on the
massive oak, ringing across the inner court and
penetrating the crooked hallways, that brought
Mario from his couch resolved to do something&mdash;he
knew not what&mdash;to save the picture.</p>

<p>“The <i>Last Supper!</i> Our Leonardo!” he exclaimed.
“It must be defended!”</p>

<p>“But what can we do, Signor Forza?” asked
Brother Sebastiano in despair. “Who can avail
against their madness? Heaven shield us! The
gate is yielding!”</p>

<p>Mario, trusting to chance to find the way,
started off in the direction of the clamour and the
sound of crackling oak. With a common impulse
the brothers followed, but he turned and besought
them not to add fuel to the wrath of the mob.
In a flash he realised that the religious as well as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
every other established order was an object of
hatred to-day, and that the wild beast out there
would be infuriated the more at sight of the cowl
and the tonsured head.</p>

<p>“Let me, at least, go with you!” Brother
Sebastiano entreated him.</p>

<p>“Yes; come and guide me to the refectory,”
Mario said, catching his arm and leading him
away, and with an upraised hand warning the
others to stay behind. “But you will go back
when I bid you?”</p>

<p>“As you will, Honourable,” the prior acquiesced
sadly, and they moved on toward the din at the
gate. When they had threaded the gloom of
many angular passages and emerged into the
sunlight of the courtyard, Mario, seeing on
the opposite side the little building that
held the picture, asked Brother Sebastiano to
return.</p>

<p>“Not yet,” said the other. “If you enter it
must be by the postern door, and I have the
key.”</p>

<p>“No, no!” Mario protested firmly. “You
must come no farther. Give me the key. Go
back, I beg you!”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>When his ear caught the last lines, jerked out
in mighty chorus by the throng in Corso Magenta,
Brother Sebastiano handed Mario the key.
“Addio,” he said to him, pressing his hand.
“Heaven guard you in this danger.”</p>

<p>“Be of good cheer,” Mario returned, and struck
across the courtyard. A moment the prior stood
there, puzzled to know what the Honourable
meant to do, and striving to reconcile his own
inactivity with his duty as head of the convent.
But, faithful to his promise, he returned to the
brothers’ inner sanctum to pray and commit the
issue to divine care.</p>

<p>At the moment Mario turned the key in the
postern the outer gate gave way, and the rioters,
with a yell of triumph, surged into the passage.
Between them and the <i>Last Supper</i> stood
yet the refectory’s front door, and the sound of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
axes on this greeted Mario as he entered. The
place was in deep gloom, relieved only by faint
gleams that stole under the heavy curtains at the
windows. To one of these he groped his way,
threw back the hanging, and let in a stream of
light that fell upon the picture but left the rest of
the room in half darkness. He would have let
in more light, but there was not time. The door
came down, and the axemen, the women with
torches, and all the vandal crew rushed into the
house made sacred by a painter’s art. At the
head of them was Red Errico&mdash;he who started
the revolt in the Tarsis silk-mill. Before they
saw the Narazene and the Twelve they beheld
Mario standing in front of the picture&mdash;a mysterious
figure at first sight, his bandaged forehead
and upraised hand thrown into weird relief by
the narrow shaft of light that played upon him
from the window. It was an apparition that
made Red Errico halt and checked for the moment
the rush of those at his back.</p>

<p>“Mario Forza!” the leader exclaimed, and the
name passed from mouth to mouth, as those in
the room moved nearer, pushed by the crowd
behind.</p>

<p>“Long live Mario Forza!” a stout-lunged
carpenter shouted. “But down with the Supper!”</p>

<p>“Well spoken! On, comrades! Down with it!”
a dozen of them chimed in, and there was a
general move toward the painting.</p>

<p>“You have right on your side!” Mario proclaimed,
in a voice sounding above the growl
of the mob. “When you wish to pull down this
work of Leonardo it is your right to do so, and no
one may say no. You are the people, and the
people must rule!”</p>

<p>“Come on, then, let us rule!” the carpenter
cried, raising his axe, ready to spring forward, but
Red Errico pulled him back.</p>

<p>“Wait!” he commanded. “Wait until the
Honourable has spoken.”</p>

<p>“Just a minute, men and women,” Mario went
on. “Just a minute let us look at the picture
before we blot it out forever. Let us have a last
look at the face of that Blessed Workman at the
middle of the table. You all know He was a
carpenter, and let me tell you that He made as
good a fight in His time to help the workingman
as you are making to-day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span></p>

<p>“Bravo!” the carpenter exclaimed, lowering
his axe.</p>

<p>“He told the rich man to sell all that he had
and give to the poor,” Mario began again, the
dissentient outbursts of his audience succeeded
now by sullen murmurs here and there. “He
told him, too, that it was harder for him to get
into Paradise than for a camel to go through a
needle’s eye. He always had a good word for
the poor, and He was never afraid to speak out.
And what happened? You all know. So I
ask you, for your good,&mdash;men and women of
Milan,&mdash;before you kill His beautiful likeness
there, as the heedless ones of old killed Him&mdash;before
you do this let us look well upon His face,
that we may remember long the man who dared
to tell the wearers of purple and fine linen that
their gifts were not so great as the widow’s mite.”</p>

<p>He paused a moment and no voice in the crowd
made reply.</p>

<p>“Most of you have looked upon this picture
before,” he continued, every ear attentive now,
“for I see among you the faces of those who live
in the neighbourhood, and the door here has
always been open.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span></p>

<p>“It wasn’t open to-day!” broke in one fellow.
“But we got in all the same. Eh, comrades?”</p>

<p>“Shut up!” commanded Red Errico, and he
was supported by others hissing for silence.
“Can’t you wait till Signor Forza has finished?”</p>

<p>“I am not here to make a long speech, friends,”
Mario said, smiling. “It is only that I thought it
would be good for all of us to have one more calm
look at the faces in this group of famous workingmen.
They were toilers, like yourselves, those
men seated on each side of Christ. It is the hour
before Gethsemane. He is going to leave them
soon, to be nailed to the cross for telling the
world that the labourer is worthy of his hire, and
other things just as true. See what honest faces
those men have&mdash;all but one! Do you see which
this is? Can you point out Judas the traitor?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!” a score of voices answered.</p>

<p>“The one next to Christ.”</p>

<p>“Donkey! There’s one on each side of Him!”</p>

<p>“He of the long nose.”</p>

<p>“The fellow that’s grasping the bag of silver!”</p>

<p>“Give us more light!” cried others in the rear
of the throng. “We can’t see much!”</p>

<p>Mario told them to pull back the hangings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
at the windows, and this was done so promptly
and with such vigour by many hands that
some of the curtains were jerked from their
fastenings.</p>

<p>“Yes; Judas has his pieces of silver,” Mario
resumed, glancing toward the man who had
observed Iscariot’s hand gripping the bribe;
“and when Christ says ‘One of you shall betray
me’ the traitor holds up one hand as if to say
‘Really, I can’t believe that.’ But you see that
the brand of guilt is on his face none the less.
What a picture it is, and how proud your forefathers
have been of it, men and women of Milan.
Do you know how long it has been on that wall?”</p>

<p>“I do!” Red Errico called out. “Four hundred
years!”</p>

<p>Mario told him he was right, and the leader’s
friends looked at Errico in awe as there rose
about his head the halo that knowledge creates
for the ignorant. “Yes; it was on this very day
four centuries ago that Leonardo gave it the last
touch. Through all that time it has told its
wondrous story, and may go on telling it to you
and your children. Who among you will be,
like Judas, the first to strike a traitorous blow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
against the best friend the wage-earner ever had?”</p>

<p>There was no response for what seemed a long
space, during which the insurgents looked one
another in the face and exchanged decisive
shakings of the head. Even Red Errico had no
words to utter except “Come away, comrades,”
as he pushed through the crowd, which went with
him toward the door. But the wild beast was
still in their bosoms, lulled to sleep only for the
moment by the words of an adroit orator. They
gave forth a sullen growl as they moved into the
street, looking back darkly at Mario, as if resentful
at heart of the power that had killed their desire
to violate the old picture.</p>

<p>For Mario, it was all he could do to keep on his
feet and make his way back across the courtyard
to where the Bemardines awaited him anxiously.
The task just accomplished had almost exhausted
his strength, ebbed to a low point, as it was, by
the blow of the cavalryman’s scabbard and the
resultant loss of blood. The wound in his forehead
throbbed painfully, and he staggered now rather
than walked. From the farther side of the close,
to which they had ventured, the brothers saw him
approach. They had caught a glimpse as well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
of the grumbling mob as it retreated from the
passage, and they knew their <i>Cenacolo</i><a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> was saved.</p>

<p>“But at what cost!” exclaimed Brother Sebastiano,
hurrying forward with the others to the
aid of Mario. “Ah, Signor Forza,” he said,
taking him by the arm, “you have made all
mankind your debtor to-day. But do not speak
now, we beg of you. Some time you will tell us
the story. Now you must rest.”</p>

<p>Scarcely had they attained the inner sanctum
when there was the sound of a halting carriage
in Via Fiori, followed by a ring of the door bell.
Presently the Cardinal appeared, his step quickened
by the account of the event in the refectory
given by Brother Ignazio on the way from the
outer door.</p>

<p>“Ah, your Eminence,” the young monk was
saying, “we feared never to look upon the Honourable’s
living face again.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, it is most wonderful that we do so
now,” was the prelate’s comment, as he seated
himself beside Mario. “Why were you left
single-handed to cope with them?” he asked,
in reproof meant for the Bemardines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span></p>

<p>“Single-voiced, rather,” Mario amended, smiling
at the Cardinal’s notion of the encounter. “It
was at my behest and against their wish that the
brothers took no part.”</p>

<p>“I think I understand,” the Cardinal said.
“There was a bull to be tamed and it was better
to keep red rags out of sight. A stroke of mind
against muscle. But in taming the bull you
have almost lost&mdash;yourself.”</p>

<p>With words that his looks did not bear out,
Mario strove to assure them all that save for the
pain where his head was cut his suffering was
slight.</p>

<p>“If your Eminence will drive me there,” he
said, “I will go to my apartments.”</p>

<p>The Bemardines protested in chorus. “Let
us care for you here,” Brother Sebastiano
pleaded.</p>

<p>“It is most kind of you,” Mario said, rising,
“but sooner or later we must part, and now I
feel able to go.”</p>

<p>Seeing him resolute, the Cardinal rose as well
and with the brothers all about them they went
to the door.</p>

<p>“To our meeting again, Signor Forza,” said the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
prior in bidding adieu. “Some day you will
come and tell us the story?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and you may expect me soon.”</p>

<p>When the rumble of the carriage had drowned
the distant roar and crackle of musketry which
told that the unequal conflict was still on, Mario
spoke his regret that the Cardinal for his sake
had lost the train to Como, and an important
engagement.</p>

<p>“I would lose all the trains in the world in such
a cause,” the other returned. “Did your going
to the convent not save our Leonardo? As to
the journey, I shall accomplish it yet by some
means. The railway strike is general. Traffic
has ceased on all the lines north and south.
When, I wonder, shall we give to the greatest of
our problems the reason we apply to the solution
of smaller ones?”</p>

<p>“We are still in social darkness,” Mario said,
and the Cardinal detected a note of despair that
was strange to him. To the leader of the New
Democracy the last two days had been a season
of broken illusion, humiliation, and quailing hope
for the cause to which he had devoted his life.
He had seen the peasantry of many provinces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
encouraged and uplifted by the co-operative
works his party had fostered; he had endured
abuse in their behalf, for his foes delighted to
brand the movement a nursery of revolt against
the established order. It was true that he had not
rested content to develop mere industrial concord.
He had striven to keep alive the ideal, the sentimental
side of the cause. Those who had risen
to the idea of his Democracy knew that it touched
humanity at every point, that its aspiration was
to imbue government with the scientific leaven of
to-day as well as the Golden Rule, to the end that
Italy’s many ills might be cured. But now, in
the face of this outbreak of class hatred, so hostile
to the spirit he had striven to awaken, he apprehended
as he never had before how little was the
progress made. He felt as a gardener who
contemplates the weeds growing faster than he
can uproot them. He must have betrayed his
gloomy reflections, for the Cardinal said, as they
turned into Via Senato, and the carriage stopped
at Mario’s door:</p>

<p>“The seed has taken root, but is not growing
to your wish. For this, my dear friend, do not
despair. We set the twig in the earth, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
heaven sends the storm to bend it to the tree’s
course. We regret the storm; but better always
a storm than a calm. Beware of calms in any
form. They are nearly akin to death. Life is
action, battle, achievement. Real success bids
us shape ourselves into God’s plan as fast as it is
revealed to us.”</p>

<p>“I thank you,” Mario said, cordially, grasping
the Cardinal’s hand. “It is the true, the clear
way, and it is full of hope. I thank your Eminence,
too, for all the kindness shown me this day.
<i>Addio</i>.”</p>

<p>“<i>Addio, caro</i> Forza.”</p>

<p>The man-servant who admitted Mario exclaimed
in horror at sight of his bandaged head, and
forgot for a time to hand him a letter inscribed
“Urgent” that had arrived by the only post
delivered in Milan that day. But he brought
it in, with many excuses, at the moment that his
master was about to seek the grateful repose of
his own bed. It was the letter Tarsis had prepared
the day before when he decided to exact
payment of Forza&mdash;the writing forged in Hera’s
hand, that should make simple the task of the
Panther in collecting the bill:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Castel-Minore, Brianza</span>, Tuesday.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">My Beloved Mario</span>:</p>

<p>I have left Antonio Tarsis and returned to my
father’s house. Of your counsel I have need. Come
to the old monastery to-morrow (Wednesday) night
at nine. Wait for me in the cloister. Yours, though
all the world oppose,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Hera</span>.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;Destroy this letter.</p>
</div>

<p>The effect was precisely what Tarsis counted
upon when he made the midnight run in the motor
car to Castel-Minore and dropped the letter into
the post-office. Mario gave the sheet to a candle
flame, destroying the only scrap that might be used
against Tarsis should the Panther, by chance,
bungle his work. Next he looked at the clock
and saw that with a good horse there was time to
reach the monastery at the hour. The new
excitement brought back the heavy throbbing
at his temples and sharper pain from the wound.
He rang for the servant and astounded him by
saying:</p>

<p>“I must go to the Brianza. There are no
trains. Have Bruno saddled at once.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX<br />
<span class="smaller">WHAT MONEY COULD NOT BUY</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Tarsis</span> spared no pains in the laying of a plan,
but that done, and the work of execution satisfactorily
begun, he awaited the result with
confidence and equable temper. It was so with
even such an exceptional emprise as that of taking
the life of Mario Forza. With the decoying
letter in the post-office, he felt that the affair was
well in train; so he went to his bed and slept
soundly. It lacked something less than two hours
of mid-day when he rang for his <i>valet de chambre</i>.
Instead of the usual prompt appearance of that
individual, he was surprised by the sleek face of
Beppe at the door; it was a pale and haggard
face as well this morning, with alarm looking out
from its heavy eyes. His voice and his hand
trembled while he explained that all the other
domestics had quit the palace an hour before.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” Tarsis asked, eyeing him
keenly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span></p>

<p>“Signore, they were afraid to stay any longer.”</p>

<p>“Of what are they afraid?”</p>

<p>“The mob, signore; the mob! Much has
happened since you went to bed. The working
people have gone mad. A gang of them entered
the palace of the Corvini and sacked it, they say,
from cellar to roof besides killing the young Duke
and three of the servants who tried to drive them
back. It is war, signore. Look!”</p>

<p>He went to the window and swept back the
drapery, to reveal the scene of a military camp.
On the opposite side of the Corso, within the
paling of the Public Gardens, a regiment of
infantry was bivouacked. For an absorbed minute
Tarsis stared out, as Beppe thought, upon the
rows of white tents and patrolling sentries; but
he had seen a solitary figure moving toward the
Venetian Gate that had more interest for him.
There was no mistaking that forward bend of the
head and slinking movement. It was the Panther.
Tarsis consulted his watch and wondered if his
accomplice were thus early on his way to the
monastery. Then he turned to Beppe and remarked,
in the tone of one coolly weighing the
situation:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span></p>

<p>“This part of the city, I take it, has been saved
from disorder so far?”</p>

<p>“Yes, signore. The troops have cut off the
quarters of the Porta Romana, Porta Ticinese,
and Porta Garibaldi from the rest of the town;
but, if the signore will permit me, there is no
telling how long they will be able to hold their
position. Signor Ulrich says the rioters may
break through and attack this part of the city
at any moment.” He spoke with a shudder
and gave a look of warning to his master.</p>

<p>“Signor Ulrich?” Tarsis repeated. “When
have you seen him?”</p>

<p>“This moment, signore. He is without.”</p>

<p>“Ask him to wait.”</p>

<p>When seated at the breakfast table, meagrely
spread with what Beppe had contrived to prepare,
Tarsis allowed the superintendent to be
ushered in. If the servant’s disquieting report
had needed verification, here it was. Those
rosy cheeks were not puffing now with excitement
and indignation against ungrateful strikers; his
lips were ashen, his voice subdued; the events of
the morning had given him an enlarged appreciation
of the meaning and possibilities of the power<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
that had risen in Italy; and the new light frightened
him.</p>

<p>Believing that bad news of the man who
held secret meetings with his wife would be
pleasing to Tarsis, the visitor’s first announcement
was that Mario Forza had been wounded. Of
the episode in Cathedral Square&mdash;the stampede
of the mob, the saving of La Ferita from the
rushing cavalry, and the inadvertent blow that
cut Forza’s forehead&mdash;Signor Ulrich was able to
narrate only so much as he had learned from the
hastily gathered accounts of the journals.</p>

<p>“Is it known if the wound is severe?” Tarsis
inquired, feigning a casual interest in the detail.</p>

<p>“One account&mdash;that of the <i>Secolo</i>, I think&mdash;says
it is not likely to prove mortal.”</p>

<p>“But it is enough to keep him from journeying
to the Brianza to-night,” Tarsis told himself, and
cursed the woman whose fall and rescue had
thwarted his purpose. He saw the Panther
waiting vainly in the gloom of the cloister and the
return to its sheath of his blade unstained with
blood. But Tarsis did not rage or brood over the
miscarried plan. He knew how to bide his time.
Moreover, there had begun to run in his veins a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
terror that made all other considerations small
indeed.</p>

<p>Signor Ulrich told his story as one might have
recounted the devastations of a tornado. His
recital was grimly quiet until he touched upon
the part played by the women. Then the pictures
of what he saw, filling his mind again, caused him
to roll up the whites of his eyes and shake his
head in token that the world had gone to the
dogs. Per Bacco! They were no longer women,
but devils from the under world! Did they not
go through fire and wreck like fiends of inferno?
Did they not bare their breasts to musket fire and
invite death?</p>

<p>Tarsis betrayed no sign of impatience, as he
was wont to do when Signor Ulrich indulged his
gift for detailed narrative. Indeed, he himself
lengthened the story by putting questions to
bring out salient facts. The general superintendent
could not credit the startling deduction, at
first, but he became positive, as the evidence
increased, that his master&mdash;Antonio Tarsis, possessor
of untold wealth, the industrial ruler who
in the past had only a smile for the demonstrations
of labour&mdash;Signor Ulrich perceived that he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
concerned, in this avalanche of rage, for the
security of his person.</p>

<p>“Do you think the military will be able to hold
them at bay until re-enforcements come?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“I am afraid not, signore,” the other replied.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because there is no certainty of the re-enforcements.”</p>

<p>“Two classes of reserves, you say, have been
summoned. Will they not respond?”</p>

<p>“Some of them tried to respond, but they were
halted by the rioters and turned back. A thousand
started this morning from Piacenza. Men
and women threw themselves in front of the train
to prevent them from proceeding. The city’s
southern gates are held by the rioters, and they
are reinforced hourly by agricultural labourers
bent on making common cause with them. I
tell you, signore, the situation is critical.”</p>

<p>“What do you think will happen?”</p>

<p>“The rioters will be masters of the city before
another sunrise.”</p>

<p>Tarsis sprang up and began to pace the floor,
but stopped suddenly, and, with a smile intended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
to be taken as one of amusement, said, “I
think you are over-counting their strength.”</p>

<p>“I hope so, signore; but General Bellori told
me that he thought every available man would
be needed to hold the gates.”</p>

<p>As if to bear out his words, the roll of drums
fell upon their ears. Looking out, Tarsis beheld
the regiment whose nearness had given him no
slight sense of security wheeling out of the Public
Gardens and moving toward Cathedral Square.
With fists clinched, he stared after the retreating
bayonets until the last one had disappeared
behind the bend of Corso Vittorio Emanuele,
while the superintendent, standing by, had eyes
only for the face of his employer. He saw the
tide of Tarsis’s helpless anger mount and strain
the veins of his neck and crimson his cheeks and
temples.</p>

<p>“Maledictions upon the weak-backed Government!”
he burst out, turning from the window.
“If they shot down the anarchists wherever they
found them, killed them by the thousand, they
would put a stop to this nonsense.”</p>

<p>“You are right, signore,” chimed in the
Austrian. “They have been too easy with them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
particularly with the women, who are ten times
worse than the men.”</p>

<p>Signor Ulrich had not overdrawn the danger.
The insurgents were nearer to a mastery of the
city than he or any one else supposed. At one
point they had cut off a large body of troops by
entrapping them into a ring of barricades. At
least half an army corps was needed if the
Government was to retain control of the
situation.</p>

<p>“The palace is wholly without defence,” Tarsis
said, after a moment of silence. “Something
must be done. I shall call up the Questura and
demand a force sufficient to protect my property.”</p>

<p>He went into the library and caught up the
receiver of the telephone; for some minutes he stood
with it pressed to his ear, but there came no
response from the central station.</p>

<p>“I think communication is broken,” Signor
Ulrich ventured to tell him. “I saw rioters
cutting down wires and stringing them across
Via Torino to impede cavalry charges.”</p>

<p>“Then we must get a message to them some
other way,” Tarsis said. “Probably it would
not be&mdash;advisable for me to go out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span></p>

<p>The other uttered an emphatic negative. “I
think it would be exceedingly unwise, Signor
Tarsis.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“The cries they raise are for blood.”</p>

<p>“What do they say?”</p>

<p>“Oh, signore! Something terrible!”</p>

<p>“Speak!”</p>

<p>“I heard them shouting, ‘Down with the
robbers of the poor!’”</p>

<p>“And you think they mean me?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think, signore.”</p>

<p>“They cry my name?”</p>

<p>The Austrian answered with a nodding of the
head.</p>

<p>“What do they say, for example?” Tarsis
asked.</p>

<p>“Some of them cry, ‘Down with Tarsis!’
Others revile you, oh, with awful epithets, signore.
They have gone mad!”</p>

<p>Tarsis threw himself in a chair, rested an arm
on the Napoleonic table, and tapped it nervously.
“I see,” he said; “the beasts would bite the
hand that has put food in their mouths. We
must act at once. Signor Ulrich, you will go to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
the Questura and give my message. Say that
I demand a guard for Palazzo Barbiondi.”</p>

<p>The little colour that had remained to the
superintendent left his face; but he said he would
go, and taking up his hat he started for the door.</p>

<p>“Tell them,” Tarsis called after him, and the
other paused&mdash;“tell them that my servants have
deserted me; that I am here absolutely alone.
Make haste, and return at all speed with their
answer.”</p>

<p>Signor Ulrich bowed his acquiescence and left
the library. When he had crossed the grand
saloon and moved through the echoing corridors
a shudder came over him to see how deserted
was the great house. The homely proverb about
rats forsaking the sinking ship occurred to his
mind and made him quicken his steps. He
glanced into the open doors that he passed, and
in the ante-room called out the name of Beppe;
but it was as the master had said&mdash;he was alone.
At the foot of the staircase, in the portico,
he stood a moment irresolute, then turned and
struck across the rear court, past the stables and
garage, to the Via Cappuccini gateway. In taking
this back street the Austrian yielded to a hunted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
feeling that had possessed him since he heard the
rioters cry, “Down with Tarsis and his crew!”
By following Via Cappuccini he would come out
by the Cathedral, and from that point it was a
few rods to the Questura.</p>

<p>Tarsis emerged from the Library and paced the
long course of the Atlantean chamber, a little
humbled in spirit, yet angry in the realisation
that there had risen a tyrant, somehow, from
somewhere, who kept him a prisoner in his own
house. He was conscious of a power that had
awakened to render him powerless. Too rich he
was to think much about his wealth, but now he
could not avert the recurrent thought that with
all his millions he was a supplicant for life’s barest
necessity.</p>

<p>It irritated him to reflect that he had been
obliged to send his man to beg the authorities
for protection. To be sure, from fixed habit of
assertive, self-important procedure, he had used
the word demand; but he knew&mdash;and the knowledge
redoubled his vexation&mdash;that it was a demand
he could not enforce. An hour had come
to him when the whole of his vast fortune was
not able to purchase the one thing that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
wanted&mdash;bodily safety. He was sensible, too,
of a dread, an invincible foreboding of calamity.
And while his vanity sustained a hope that the
authorities must send word of assurance, his
newly illumined reason said the message more
likely would show him how a beggar might be
answered.</p>

<p>The sun neared its setting. All the afternoon
its light had played through the glazed dome down
on the tessellated pavement; now those cheerful
beams had stolen away. Everything in the great
chamber upon which his eye fell seemed to mock
his wretchedness. With hideous leers the vacant
orbs of the Atlantes followed him, and he ended
by bowing his head to shut out the sight. Twice
he walked the length of the room, then stopped
at a window, drew the curtain, and peered out,
first upon the gold-tipped foliage of the Public
Gardens, then upon the reach of broad Corso
northward as far as the Venetian Gate.</p>

<p>The sidewalks were alive with moving throngs.
They had the aspect of people of the class he had
seen walking there on other evenings&mdash;a stratum
of the bourgeois who had an hour to spare before
dinner, returning from their promenade on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
Bastions. He remembered that he and Hera
had watched them together more than once after
a drive. At close range anxiety might have been
read in the faces of some and heard in the voices
of others; but from where he looked there was
naught to suggest that in another part of the town
riot and bloodshed had held the stage since sunrise.
It was a peaceful enough concourse of citizens;
and yet, the scene filled Tarsis with a shuddering
dismay. That terror which makes of the stoutest
heart a trembling craven was upon him&mdash;the
terror of the mob.</p>

<p>He was about to turn from the window, impatient
that Signor Ulrich did not come back&mdash;although
the man had not had time, without the
loss of a minute, to reach the Questura, submit
the “demand,” and retrace his steps&mdash;when he
noted that the faces of the people were turning
all in one direction; their gaze was setting upon
some one who approached from a point toward
Cathedral Square that was beyond his range of
vision. Waiting to see who or what it might
be that attracted so much attention, he stood
there, the curtains scarcely parted, dimly conscious
of the rose flush in the sky beyond the trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span></p>

<p>Down the Corso he heard “Vivas!” shouted;
a minute more and he saw a man on horseback
drawing near; he wore no head covering save a
bandage about his brows. The grim smile that
was common to Tarsis in moments of triumph
curved his lips. He needed no glass to know the
rider; the sight of him stirred a nest of stinging
memories.</p>

<p>“Cheer, you fools, cheer!” he muttered, glancing
toward a group of acclaiming men. “It is your
last chance. Never again will you see him alive!”</p>

<p>In the sinister delight of the certainty that
there would be work for the Panther after all,
he forgot for a moment the perils that hedged
him round. He went to the last window of the
palace’s long row, that he might keep the horseman
in view as long as possible. At length he turned
away well content, for he had seen him pass
through the Venetian Gate.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE HEART’S LAW-MAKING</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt</span> Beatrice’s pride of blood was large and
her sympathy for the peasant folk small; yet,
when it came to expressing a primary emotion
she was not above borrowing from the rugged
phrases of her humbler neighbours. Thus it fell
out that when she had recovered from the shock
of Hera’s home-coming so far as to credit her
bewildered senses, and hold the appalling situation
in perspective, she summed it up in this wise:</p>

<p>“We have indeed returned to our muttons.”</p>

<p>It was in the solitude of her own apartment
that she arrived at this homely epitome, and saw,
in despair, that the final crash of the House of
Barbiondi was near. By her niece’s eccentricity,
as she chose to call it, the future of ease her genius
designed and made a reality had been transformed
into one of poverty, with the abominable insecurities
and detestable humiliations that had haunted
nearly all her days. A picture of money-lenders,
dress-makers, tailors, and purveyors of meat and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
drink, each with a bill in hand, marching in clamorous
phalanx through the villa gateway, rose
to her excited fancy and made her flesh creep.
She knew that she would never be able again to
play Amazon against those storming hosts. Of
courage and strategic skill she had proved herself
the abundant possessor throughout the family’s
uncertain career, but now her spirit lay crushed
in the dust, like that of a military commander
who has seen a magnificent victory ruthlessly
flung away.</p>

<p>The frosty welcome that Hera received from
her aunt did not surprise, however it may have
pained her; but she had comfort in the assurance
that her father’s arms would be open to greet her;
she knew the loyalty of his affection and sympathy
as well as she comprehended the frailty of his
nature in other respects. When he entered the
room she flew to his outstretched arms, and
without a word being spoken as to the occasion
of her return she saw in his eye a light of
understanding.</p>

<p>“I have come home to stay, <i>babbo</i>,” was all she
felt it needful to tell him.</p>

<p>“Brava, daughter mine!” he said. “Ah, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
have longed for the day. I knew it must
come.”</p>

<p>It was impossible for Aunt Beatrice to answer
to the feeling of relief and gladness that expressed
itself in the countenance of father and daughter;
her thought turned rather to Tarsis, whom she
could see in no other light than that of a man
cruelly wronged by his wife. She did not deny
herself the privilege of candid observations to
this effect, which Don Riccardo and Hera heard
with patience. But when she urged Hera to
reconsider her act and begged her father to
realise, before it might be too late, that ruin to the
family must result, Don Riccardo spoke his mind.
He had learned somewhat through suffering, and
the example of his daughter had quickened his
latent strength.</p>

<p>He answered her that he did not care! Ruin
or no ruin, he was glad that events had taken this
turn. The worst that could betide, he declared, a
trifle grandiloquently, was material want; starvation,
perhaps. Was not that a better fate than to
live on with his daughter a hostage to fortune, held
in luxurious thraldom? Hera listened and rejoiced
for the sense of respect that came now to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
mingle with the love she had always borne her
father.</p>

<p>The scene was interrupted at this point by a
servant’s announcement that Colonel Rosario
was in the reception hall. His regiment of
Bersaglieri, on the march to Milan in response
to a call for reinforcements, had halted near by.
The Duke and his daughter went at once to greet
him.</p>

<p>“My men,” said the old soldier, “are at your
gate, and their commander is at your disposal
for luncheon.”</p>

<p>“Bravo! A thousand welcomes!” exclaimed
Don Riccardo, as he pressed the other’s hand and
checked an impulse to add, “You could not have
arrived at a more logical moment; when last you
honoured our board we were rejoicing for my
daughter’s fancied escape; now we are glad for
her real one.” But no hint was given him of the
reason for Hera’s presence in the villa.</p>

<p>Donna Beatrice did not appear until just before
the hour for luncheon. In solitude she continued
her struggle with the new predicament until she
had to acknowledge herself beaten. She could not
cope at all with this new-born spirit of disdain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
for consequences evinced by her brother and his
amazing daughter. The poor woman’s one hope
was that the resourceful Tarsis might find a way
to save them from themselves.</p>

<p>When she had taken her place at the table
opposite Colonel Rosario, it seemed to her all the
more urgent that some strong hand should curb
their reckless course. Here she found herself
in an atmosphere of cheerfulness, even gaiety,
that was scandalously at odds with the gloom
demanded by the terrible situation. Actually,
the wife who had forsaken her husband because
of some foible was able to sit there and eat and
drink, and laugh over the rugged jokes of an old
soldier. And the father of this disgraced daughter
was so lost to shame that he outdid the others in
merriment. Misericordia! They were turning the
calamity into a jubilee! She breathed a thanksgiving
when Colonel Rosario had left the house
and she saw the bayonets glinting in the sun, as
the Bersaglieri marched toward Milan.</p>

<p>Although convinced from the moment of
Hera’s return that Mario Forza was the <i>diabolus
ex machina</i>, as she phrased it, Donna Beatrice,
by a heroic act of self-restraint, had refrained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
from speaking her mind to that effect. Bitterly
she regretted the omission an hour after luncheon
when she saw Hera riding forth alone, as she did in
the old days. From a window she watched her,
now through breaks in the foliage, now over the
tops of the trees, while she moved down the
winding road of the park. She saw the white
plume of her hat pass under the gateway arch
and caught a glimpse of her beyond the wall as
she rode away.</p>

<p>“A tryst with Mario Forza!” she assured herself;
and, stirred to action by the abhorrent thought,
she sent a servant for her brother, that she might
break a lance with him on this aspect of the case.
The footman informed her that his Excellency
was having his afternoon nap.</p>

<p>“Napping!” she exclaimed, audibly; and then
to herself: “At this critical moment! Napping
when his daughter is in danger!”</p>

<p>Hera followed the margin of Old Adda, light
of heart, receiving the joy of verdure, and forgetful
of past trials in her new sensation of freedom.
She breathed in the fragrance that blossoms gave
the surrounding air. Bird voices, few the last
time she rode that way, sounded all about. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
poplars on either side of the river&mdash;grim black
brushes a few weeks before&mdash;made two noble files
of plumes quivering silver or green in response to
every wandering breeze. The river was almost
as quiet as the lake from which it flowed. Sparrows
bathed in the dust and chased one another
on the wing close to the ground. White vapours,
floating in clearest blue, were motionless as
painted clouds.</p>

<p>She passed idlers reclining on the greensward
of the roadside&mdash;sun-burned men and women
who, by the immemorial law of the season, should
have been busy in the fields. She saw more
idlers before the village tavern. They were
gathered about a comrade who read from a
big-headlined journal of Milan. The group would
have received no attention from her but for one
boisterous fellow who crossed the road calling
out the news to a neighbour in his window. She
heard distinctly the name of Mario Forza, but more
than this she was not able to make out. Nevertheless,
she had heard enough to send her back
to the tavern. As she drew rein the men turned
from the reader and one and all bared their
uncombed heads. She asked the news from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
Milan, and the man who had been reading came
forward, clearing his throat for a speech.</p>

<p>“Most excellent signora,” he began, “the
bugle call has sounded, and throughout the
length and breadth of our fair land the battalions
of labour are marching. The sun of the social
revolution has risen. The invincible industrial
army&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Shut up, Pietro!” commanded a brawny
blacksmith, snatching the journal from the
orator’s hand. “If your Excellency would like
to read,” he said, offering the paper to Hera.</p>

<p>While she cast her eye over the printed page
some of the men gathered about her horse, their
bronzed faces upturned to hers and upon them a
dull expression of triumph in the story of riot
and bloodshed that was unfolded. Presently
they saw her start with catching breath, drop the
paper to her side, and sit her saddle in silence a
moment, oblivious of the many eyes upon her,
and staring off in the direction of Milan.</p>

<p>“It is a fine uprising, Excellency, neh?” one
of the men said, but Hera had only a nod of the
head for reply.</p>

<p>She rode on, carrying an indistinct idea, gained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
from the huge captions, of a situation with which
the Government found itself all but powerless
to cope; of anarchy in Milan, of hundreds of men
and women laid low or killed by the troops; but
the announcement that loomed above all to her
mind was that Mario Forza had been shot. “At
this hour,” ran the account, “exact details are
not obtainable. From what could be gathered
concerning the deplorable incident, it appears
that the mob in Cathedral Square was at the time
stampeding before the charge of a detachment of
the Ninth Cavalry. A woman whose name
could not be learned, but who is said to be one of
the rioters, was knocked down in the mad rush
and would have been trampled to death by the
horses but for the timely appearance and intrepid
action of the Honourable Forza. He sprang in
front of the advancing troopers, and catching up
the woman in his arms was bearing her out of
harm’s way, when a shot, evidently intended
for the soldiers, was fired by one of the mob.
The mark that the bullet found was Signor Forza.
It was not known, however, that he was struck
until he had borne the woman to a point of
safety. Then he was seen to sway as if swooning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
but some bystanders steadied him. He was
conveyed to the General Hospital by a friend
whose carriage stood by.”</p>

<p>Her instinct to go to him became a mastering
purpose. Although she did no more than walk
her horse for a while, she kept moving toward
Milan. She reflected that the remaining distance
was little more than two leagues and that she
could travel it easily before dark. In a minute
she was resolved, and speaking to her horse she
set forward at a smarter pace. For the proprieties
of the case she was in no mood to borrow care.
He was wounded, perhaps unto death, and her one
thought was to go to the hospital and be at his
side. As she pursued her way, now in the sunshine
of open road, now in the shade of a wood,
she had time to consider what idle tongues might
say, but it did not make her slacken speed or
think of turning back.</p>

<p>On every hand her eye met evidence of the
social recoil that had set in. Here, as in the
neighbourhood of her father’s house, the farm
labourers had been caught in the wave of revolt
that surged from Milan. All the fields she passed
were deserted. The taverns of the roadside were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
busy, and, however true the cry of bread famine
may have been, there was no famine in juice of
the grape and no scarcity of drinkers. In the
village of Bosco Largo she heard again the name
of Mario Forza. It fell from the lips of an impassioned
ploughman haranguing a crowd of
excited men and women. Two stern-visaged carbineers
stood by, but their presence only fanned
the flame of his speech.</p>

<p>“It was the military that shot him down,” he
declared. “And would you know why, my
comrades? I will tell you: Because he is the
friend of the man or woman who toils. That’s
why they wanted to kill him&mdash;because he is the
friend of labour. They don’t want labour to
have any friends except dead friends.”</p>

<p>“True, true!” came from the crowd.</p>

<p>“They are trying to tell us that one of the
people shot Mario Forza,” the orator went on.
“Ha, ha! The capitalistic press wants to ram
that down our throats. But they can’t do it.
I brand that assertion a lie. The press and the
Government are the slaves of capital, and they’ll
do anything, say anything to serve their masters.
Bah! What right have they to come to us who do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
the work and say, ‘You may keep one tenth of
what you produce; the rest you must hand over
to us’? What right, I ask, have they to tax the
bread out of our children’s mouths and the coats
off our backs? And what do they do with the
money that they plunder us of? I will tell you:
They use it to pay things like those over there&mdash;those
things with the carbines&mdash;they hire them
to shoot us down if we say that our souls are our
own. That’s what they spend our earnings
for!”</p>

<p>There was a deluge of hisses for the carbineers.
They made no reply, by word, look or gesture,
although some of the women shook their fists at
them and snarled in their faces like tigresses.</p>

<p>“On to Milan, comrades!” the ploughman cried,
pointing dramatically toward the city. “On
to Milan and help our brothers pull down the
capitalistic Bastile!”</p>

<p>“Bravo! On to Milan! Down with the
capitalistic Bastile!”</p>

<p>Repeating the cry, they scattered, men and
women alike, to their homes, to get rakes, hoes,
scythes, shovels, axes, or any other implement
with which to arm themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span></p>

<p>Hera had lingered to catch the words about
Mario, and then, impelled by the thought that
she might arrive at the hospital only to find him
lifeless, she pressed forward, urging her horse to
greater speed. Behind her, more than a league,
she had left the river, her course lying now through
a country green with maize, over a road that
slanted to the south-west from the town of San
Michele; keeping to this she would enter upon
the Monza Road not far from Milan’s Venetian
Gate.</p>

<p>She was one of the many now that fared
toward the city. The road swarmed with the
peasantry, as on festal days, only it was plain that
this was no holiday throng. In groups the people
moved onward, most of them afoot, a few women
on sorry nags, and others with their children in
rumbling farm carts. Beneath their sullen demeanour
seethed a spirit of contempt for
established things. They called to one another in
the shrill <i>mezzo canto</i> of their dialect, scoffing at
authority and boasting of what they would do
to pull it down.</p>

<p>Once or twice Hera came upon a band of farm
hands marching with a semblance of line that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
bespoke service in the army. For weapons they
carried scythes and pitchforks. Here and there
a woodman, shouldering a glistening axe, swaggered
along with fine assurance of success in his
mission to fell the oak of capitalism. “Long live
the industrial army!” was the cry that greeted
the marching ones oftenest as they trudged on,
their faces set with determination.</p>

<p>It was an experience that asked a stout heart
of Hera. In the cross-currents of her thought
she realised that a signora from the world of ease
and plenty was not a popular figure in that
concourse. But there must have been that in
her face which had power to touch those rugged
hearts, angry though they were; and she met
with no more annoyance than an occasional black
scowl.</p>

<p>In the suburb of Villacosa she overtook Colonel
Rosario’s regiment. The Bersaglieri were moving
with the spirited swing that is their pride,
canteens clanking, the long plumes of their hats
waving, and the dust of the highway astir in their
wake. By people who had a well-fed aspect
they were greeted with pleased countenances,
but in discreet silence; their less prosperous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
neighbours had only hisses and hoots for the
uniformed marchers. Mothers held up their
babes and cried, “Fire now, I beg of you.” Other
women threw themselves on the roadside, pulled
up tufts of grass, and made as if to eat them&mdash;a bit
of theatricalism intended to typify the extremity
to which they were reduced for food.</p>

<p>As Hera came up with the head of the column
the Colonel chanced to look round; their glances
met, and he smiled a cordial recognition. But a
puzzled look succeeded the smile when Hera had
passed ahead and he had seen the foam that
whitened the rings of her horse’s bit and the
flakes of it that dappled his chest. And she was
riding yet as fast as she could in that teeming road.
The sun had set when she turned into the Monza
highway. An exodus from Milan had begun.
She encountered a stream of vehicles loaded with
the fugitives and their baggage; most of them
were foreigners bound for the more tranquil air
of near-by Swiss cantons.</p>

<p>A little longer and she was in the quarter of
Milan’s new rich, without the walls&mdash;amid dwellings
of an architecture that in Rome, Florence
or Turin produces much the same impression.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
Every portico gate was bolted, no fountains
leaped in the courts, blinds were drawn at the
windows; nowhere in any of the grand houses was
there sign of life. She could see the Venetian
Gate a short distance ahead; but between her
and it rose a barrier of howling men and women
that reached from side to side of the road save for
a narrow breach through which the refugees
passed. Over the heads of the crowd she caught
the glitter of a line of bayonets, and drawing
near she heard the jibes and maledictions that
were poured upon the soldiers. She found that
she could proceed no farther. An hour earlier
the King had declared Milan in a state of siege.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI<br />
<span class="smaller">A CALL TO SERVICE</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hera</span> found herself one of the hundreds of
peaceful visitors shut out in company with the
rabble that was eager to feed the furnace of
rebellion. Awhile she sat her horse wondering
what she might do to gain entrance to the city.
There was no recourse but to make herself known
to the guards and entreat them for leave to pass;
and she was on the point of that appeal, which
must have proved vain, when a burst of martial
music and the acclaim a crowd gives marching
men made her pause. She knew it must be the
regiment of Colonel Rosario, and her heart leaped
with gladness.</p>

<p>First the plumes and shining brass of the musicians
came into view, then the figure of her
father’s old comrade at the head of his men. For
a minute she watched the Bersaglieri wheel into
the broad highway and swagger toward the town;
but when she saw the column halt before all of it
had made the turning she rode as fast as she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
could through the ruck of men and vehicles to the
Colonel’s side.</p>

<p>“Donna Hera!” the commander exclaimed,
saluting her in military form and covering his
amazement with a smile.</p>

<p>“They will not let me go on,” she told him
without ado.</p>

<p>“And you are obliged to return to Villa Barbiondi
to-night,” he added, as if comprehending.
“That is a difficulty, to be sure, but one not
insurmountable. For example, I will send Major
Quaranta with you to the villa if you do not
object.”</p>

<p>“No, no!” she said, impulsively. “You are
kind, but&mdash;oh, I cannot go back to-night. I must
enter the city at once. It is an affair&mdash;of life
and death.”</p>

<p>Colonel Rosario was not the man to question
when a lady&mdash;and the daughter of his life-long
friend&mdash;spoke thus, although a king’s command
and the wall of a besieged city stood between him
and the attainment of her wish.</p>

<p>“If you do not mind helping me lead the regiment,”
he said, his eyes beaming, “we shall
manage it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span></p>

<p>He gave the order to advance. The drum-major’s
baton went up, and the column moved,
Hera riding beside the Colonel. The latter kept
his eyes straight ahead, as if unconscious of the
radiant woman whose skirts almost touched his
stirrup, and Hera looked neither to right nor left.
Her presence was a breach of military decorum
that puzzled the officers’ minds, but pleased their
eyes, as it did those of the crowd that flanked
the way. Few jibes were hurled at the soldiers,
and more than once a cheer was given for the
beautiful signora. At the gate the musicians
gave forth the national quickstep, to which the
Bersaglieri march best, and the guards posted to
maintain the siege marvelled to see a whole
regiment escort one lady into Milan.</p>

<p>They passed to the inner side of the wall at the
moment that Mario Forza, in response to the
spurious call of Tarsis, set out from his house in
Via Senato. As the head of the line wheeled into
the Bastion drive by the Public Gardens Hera,
with only a look into the Colonel’s face to speak
her gratitude, kept on her way in the Corso. By
this time Mario too had entered that street, and
had she continued in it they must have met under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
the eyes of Tarsis and set at naught his scheme of
revenge. As it was she turned into Via Borghetto,
meaning to reach the hospital in a detour through
by-ways. It could not have been more than two
minutes after she had left the Corso when Tarsis,
behind the window drapery, saw Mario pass on his
way to the monastery.</p>

<p>From little Via Borghetto Hera moved into the
Monforte Bastions and followed that broad
highway to Via Cappuccini, the narrow street that
bordered the rear gardens of Palazzo Barbiondi.
She had gone a few paces beyond the gateway
of the palace when the crackle of musketry not
far off startled her senses. As the reverberations
died out there rose in stronger volume a hoarse
din of human voices sounding, it seemed, from a
point between where she was and the General
Hospital. And she wondered if she would be able,
after all to reach the place where they said Mario lay.</p>

<p>At a crook in the street an unseen hand gave
the bridle a violent pull and brought her horse to
a standstill. The dusk of the narrow way had
become heavy, but in the affrighted, yellow-bearded
face of the man who had stopped her
she recognised Signor Ulrich.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span></p>

<p>“A thousand pardons!” he began, out of
breath. “There is great danger. Your Excellency
had best go to the palace at once.”</p>

<p>Perceiving him unaware that the palace was
no longer her abode, she thanked him and would
have ridden on. “I must keep on my way,”
she said.</p>

<p>But he held fast to the bridle rein.</p>

<p>“Excellency, go and warn your husband,”
he entreated her. “In the face of his deadly
peril he is alone&mdash;all alone. There is not a second
to lose.”</p>

<p>While he spoke he turned her horse around.</p>

<p>“Of what would you have me warn him?” she
asked, displeased with his meddling.</p>

<p>“Of that!” he answered, pointing to where the
firing and human roar arose from the huddle of
narrow streets. “It is no time for a lady to ride,”
he added, offensively, “even&mdash;even if the Honourable
Forza is not afraid to be abroad.”</p>

<p>“Signor Forza?” she repeated, puzzled to know
his meaning.</p>

<p>“Yes, Excellency. Oh, I saw him not very far
away,” he asserted, with an insolent effect of
shrewdness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span></p>

<p>A moment she looked him in the eye, conscious
that in the lawless spirit of the hour, he had
spoken as he would not have dared in a calmer
day; but, eager for the news of Mario, she ignored
the insult conveyed in the Austrian’s insinuating
phrases and manner.</p>

<p>“The journals,” she said, “have it that Signor
Forza is in the hospital, dying.”</p>

<p>“That is false. He is not in the hospital, and
he is far from dying, if I am a judge.”</p>

<p>“When did you see Signor Forza?”</p>

<p>“Not five minutes ago.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“In the Corso, going toward the Venetian Gate.”</p>

<p>“But he has been wounded.”</p>

<p>“Not enough to keep him from the saddle.”</p>

<p>“He was on horseback?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Excellency. Oh I beg you, go and warn
your husband of his danger.”</p>

<p>“He must know,” Hera said, absently, her
mind dwelling on the assurance that Mario was
alive and would live.</p>

<p>“He does not know the worst,” the other told
her. “I went to demand protection&mdash;soldiers
to guard him. At the Questura they almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
mocked me. The mob has broken through the
military lines and is sweeping this way.”</p>

<p>“Will they attack the palace?”</p>

<p>“Attack! They have only to walk in.”</p>

<p>“Why do you think they mean to harm Signor
Tarsis?”</p>

<p>“I heard them crying out for his life. Go, oh,
go and save him! There is time for escape by the
Corso gate.’”</p>

<p>“Why do you not go to him?” Hera asked.</p>

<p>“I! Oh, Excellency! If you had heard
them cry out against us. They will burn
and slay. None whom they hate will be
spared.”</p>

<p>From her heart sprang a wish that dazzled
with its splendid hope, but left her in the next
instant filled with shame. “Addio, Excellency,”
she heard the Austrian saying; “for me, I am off.”
Then she was aware of his waving hand as he
withdrew up a narrow way that cut through to
Corso Vittorio Emanuele. Her eyes took in the
bulk of his receding figure, but her thought was
not with him. In the glimmer of an outhung
lamp she saw him turn about and with a forefinger
stab the air in the direction of Palazzo Barbiondi.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
She strove to rally the forces of her mind&mdash;to
set some rule over her contending impulses.</p>

<p>With equal power the voice of moral obligation
and that of pure desire made their plea. Now the
duty of a wife pointed the way, now her love for
Mario. Insistently the prospect of Tarsis dead
mingled itself with a vision of her fetters struck
off&mdash;her heart no longer bond, but free to obey
the law it had broken. She had prayed that
Mario’s life might be spared, and now she was
tempted to leave her husband to his destiny, to go
on to the love for which her soul hungered, to
claim the happiness that seemed ordained of events.
In the minute that she waited, a captive of warring
emotions, shop-keepers up and down the street
were putting shutters to their windows and
shouting to her, “To your home, signora; to your
home!” The air grew thick with the roar of the
mob. A few seconds and it would be too late
to save the life that meant death to her happiness.</p>

<p>“Down with Tarsis!” The cry was so near as
to rise distinct out of the fearful dissonance.
And in an impulse that came as the words fell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
upon her ears she gave her horse a stroke of the
whip and galloped hard for the palace gates.
In the court she sprang from the saddle, ran past
the garage and stables, reached the main portico,
and hurried up the grand staircase and through
the gloom of the corridors, calling the name of
her husband&mdash;“Antonio! Antonio!” There was
no answer save the chuckling echo of the great
halls. She gained the Atlantean chamber, and,
thinking of the library where he spent so much
of his time, made for the door of it, at the farther-most
angle of the great room. Knocking stoutly,
she called out again:</p>

<p>“It is I, Hera!”</p>

<p>On the other side there was the sound of
movement, the striking of a match; then the door
was opened, and she beheld Tarsis, a lighted
candle in his trembling hand. In that moment
all the bitterness he had planted in her soul gave
way before a flood of pity.</p>

<p>“I knew your voice,” he said, weakly. “Why
have you come back?”</p>

<p>“To tell you to fly! The mob will be
here!”</p>

<p>He seemed to be in a stupor of fear. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
thought I heard them,” he said, huskily. “Are
they coming to the palace?”</p>

<p>“Yes; they have broken through the military
lines. Signor Ulrich told me.”</p>

<p>“Signor Ulrich! You saw him?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he has fled. He said that he heard
them crying out against you!”</p>

<p>“What did they say at the Questura? Am
I not to have my guard of carbineers?”</p>

<p>“There is no time for a guard,” she answered,
taking hold of his sleeve. “I tell
you that the mob is approaching up Via
Cappuccini. Come! We can go out by the Corso
gate.”</p>

<p>“Yes; let us go,” he said, and started across
the vast apartment, Hera at his side, while the
candle in his shaking hand made their shadows
do a strange fandango. In their ears was the
roar of human fury, sifted by the encompassing
walls into a haunting murmur. They passed
the picture of Heribert and his warriors and were
at the point of setting foot in the corridor, when
they halted and looked each other in the
face.</p>

<p>“My God!” Tarsis breathed, and would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
let fall the candle, but Hera caught it and held it
still lighted. “It is too late!”</p>

<p>He was in the last extremity of fright, with a
face the colour of clay and his limbs quaking as
one who has an ague.</p>

<p>“We must go back,” Hera said, and drew at
his coat sleeve, for he seemed to have lost
power to move from where he stood. Her
thought flew to the library as a harbour of
safety.</p>

<p>“Come,” she said to him; “they may not think
to look there.”</p>

<p>Across the field of tessellated marble they
retraced their steps, he following her, clinging
close to her, as a child might have clung to its
guardian. A sudden horror had mastered him,
a sense of retribution at hand. The monster of
poverty, which he had belittled as a bogey of the
demagogue, was speaking to him with no uncertain
voice. He could hear the workers, whom
he had never thought of before as an army of
might, coming in their corporate strength to be
his executioner.</p>

<p>Tarsis entered the library first, and would
have taken no precaution other than to close the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
door and lock it; but Hera bethought herself to
draw to the silken hanging that hid the entrance
from view on the other side. Then she closed the
door and turned the key. Silently, powerlessly,
they awaited the hazard of events.</p>

<span class="smaller">TARSIS ARRAIGNED</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Half</span> a minute more and they knew the mob
had entered the Atlantean chamber. First they
heard the howl of triumph and the trampling,
rough-shod feet on the marble pavement; then the
thud and crash of objects falling and the shattering
of glass. They were able to guess that Demos
was venting his fury on the Barbiondi portraits,
the mirrors, and the carved Atlantes. But these
incidents in the attempted remaking of Italy
were of little moment to the man and woman in
hiding. The only sound they dreaded was that
which the tearing away of the drapery before
their retreat would make and the trying of the
handle of the door. Tarsis had dropped into a
chair near the window, the curtain of which he
clutched with one hand, and listened, as if with
every nerve, for the fateful signal. Hera was on
her feet, calm in the consciousness of duty performed,
resolved to die bravely, if die she must.
Presently the summons came. The drapery was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
jerked down and a violent hand rattled the door
knob.</p>

<p>“We’ve found the fox’s hole!”</p>

<p>“Here’s Tarsis!”</p>

<p>“Axes, comrades! Down with the door!”</p>

<p>It was not many seconds before the oaken
barrier yielded to the assault of the axes that had
levelled the gates of the Santa Maria convent;
for this was the same detachment of the rioters,
grown like a snowball as it moved, but led still by
Red Errico. The yell of triumph which the
insensate crew set up as they poured in stopped
suddenly, because it was not the object of their
fury that they found. Tarsis had vanished.
They beheld in his stead a woman young and of
great beauty, standing alone&mdash;calm, imperious,
unafraid. A hush came over those in front as
they fell back, every impassioned face turned to
hers, and the black smoke of the torches filling
the room.</p>

<p>At length one of the women spoke. “We don’t
want you, signora,” she said. “It’s Tarsis.
Where is he?”</p>

<p>“I do not know,” Hera answered, and it was
the truth, for she had not seen him leave the place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
at the window where he crouched before the door
was assailed; but a general muttering and shaking
of heads told her the answer was unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>“You ought to know,” one woman said,
shrewdly, going a step nearer. “Why don’t
you?”</p>

<p>“I am not the guardian of Signor Tarsis,” she
replied, defiantly, but not wisely; and there was a
resentful growl from the mob, which had kept
pressing into the library.</p>

<p>“Oh, you are not his keeper, eh?” the first
questioner snapped back.</p>

<p>“You’d better not play grand with us!” another
woman warned her, shaking a finger in Hera’s face.</p>

<p>“We are the bosses now,” a third announced.
“And it will serve you, my fine lady, to keep a
civil tongue.”</p>

<p>The sentiment was applauded by an outburst
of “Bravas!” Some of the invaders had begun
to ransack the room in search of Tarsis. They
pulled out the drawers of cabinets, flung open the
doors beneath the book-shelves, and peered into
closets. The next one to speak to Hera was Red
Errico, who had pushed his way to the front.</p>

<p>“If you are not his keeper, signora,” he said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
with mock deference, “perhaps you will condescend
to tell us who you are?”</p>

<p>“I am his wife,” she answered, and the black
looks faded from some of the faces. They knew
her by her works among the poor of the Porta
Ticinese quarter. One woman who had benefited
by her charities began to acclaim her praise.</p>

<p>“Donna Hera of the Barbiondi!” she cried.
“Evviva! She is a friend of the people!”</p>

<p>“Viva Donna Hera!” chimed in others who had
tasted of her bounty.</p>

<p>Red Errico commanded silence. “Where is
your husband, signora?” he asked, his suspicion
unallayed; but before she could tell them again
that she did not know the answer came from the
woman who, above all others in that angry horde,
wanted to find the master of the palace.</p>

<p>“Here he is!” she exclaimed, her voice weakened
with shouting all day, and cracking now in the
frenzy of her triumph. “Here he is.”</p>

<p>She had grabbed the nearest torch and was
holding it above the face of Tarsis. Every eye
turned to the window where she stood, the curtain
jerked back, disclosing the man for whose blood
she was mad cowering in the embrasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span></p>

<p>“Murderer!” she shrieked at him, shaking a
fist in his face. “You killed my child!”</p>

<p>He was like a figure of stone, save for his eyes,
which contracted and expanded as fast as he
gasped for breath. One of his hands gripped a
paper knife that he had caught up when the door
began to yield. It was in the hot blood of them
to fall upon him then and there, and so it would
have been but for Red Errico. He sprang forward
and, with one hand pushing back La Ferita, the
other upraised, he commanded them to wait.</p>

<p>“Not yet!” he called out. “You forget! We
must give the robber a trial. They do as much
for us when we take rather than starve. A trial,
do you understand? There are some questions
we want to ask him, neh, comrades?”</p>

<p>At first he was answered with howls of dissatisfaction,
but with them were mingled cries of
approval; and presently, the idea of the leader’s
joke sinking into their wits and gaining general
favour, there were many demands, amid mocking
laughter, for a trial.</p>

<p>“Great fun! Bravo, Errico! A trial for the
robber of the poor!”</p>

<p>The surge of the crowd did not move Hera from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
where she stood&mdash;backward against the wall.
She saw them lay hold of Tarsis, wrench the paper-cutting
toy from his grasp, and, lifting him bodily,
carry him through the jeering, laughing herd, and
set him upon his cherished Napoleonic table.
Then they flocked around with vituperative malice.
In an hour of mastery they displayed the worse
traits of their class. The women put out their
claws and scratched his face, pulled his hair, and
spat upon him, and covered him with the vilest
epithets of their patois. It was the barbarous
culmination of a movement which to Tarsis had
always seemed so far away. Red Errico, exercising
the function of judge, tweaked the prisoner’s
nose and ordered him to sit up and look happy.</p>

<p>La Ferita, her scar glowing hideously, kept
crying, “Down with him, I say! Bah for your
trial! He killed my child!”</p>

<p>The air was stifling with the smoke of torches.
Tarsis coughed and was barely able to hold up his
head.</p>

<p>“Why do you persecute me?” he said, his voice
faintly audible. “I have never harmed you.”</p>

<p>The few who heard burst into derisive laughter
and passed the words along; and the whole pack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
took them up with such rough comments as they
could invent.</p>

<p>“And so, my fine fellow,” was Red Errico’s
sneer, “you have never harmed us! Bravissimo!
But you are a magnificent liar, signore&mdash;magnificent!
Now for the trial! Question No. 1: How
comes it that you are the possessor of millions,
that you live in a grand house, eat the fat of the
earth, while we who have worked for you, we who
have produced the things that have brought your
wealth, are scarcely able to keep body and soul
together?”</p>

<p>The others had quieted so much that nearly all
could hear the question, and they pressed about
their prey, brandishing clinched fists in his face
and saying, “Answer that, you thief! Answer that!”</p>

<p>Tarsis seemed too weak to articulate. He
moved his hand in signal that he had no answer
to make, as he did to other questions put by the
judge. Haggardly he shook his head once and
avowed that he had not robbed them; that he had
given thousands of people work, making it possible
for them to earn a living; but a blast of
malevolent “Bahs!” was their reply to that
defence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” Red Errico said, “you have got all the
work out of us you could, and paid us enough to
keep us from starvation, so that we might go on
piling up the millions for you.”</p>

<p>“True! True!” the others chorused. “But
it’s our turn now. Neh? Our turn now.”</p>

<p>“Down with him!” was La Ferita’s argument.
“He gave my little Giulia work in his mill and
paid her fifteen soldi a day. Oh, yes; he gave
her work. He worked her to death!”</p>

<p>For prelude to a new attack Errico shook his
finger in Tarsis’s face. “You are a common
thief!” he declared, savagely; “but there’s no
law for your kind of thieving except the law that
you’re getting now. You knew how to manage
so that we should never get a fair share of what
we earned. You have been too keen for us poor
devils. You have known how to keep a pound
while you gave us a grain; and now you have the
gall to say that you have given us a chance to live.
It is we, poor fools, who have given you the chance
to rob us. But that time is gone. We are awake
at last!”</p>

<p>Tarsis was without strength to frame a reply
to this exposition of industrial philosophy; but,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
while the crowd applauded and poured anew
their execration upon him, he raised his hand as if
for silence. Every head bent forward and every
ear strained to catch his words.</p>

<p>“You do me a great injustice,” he said. “I
have given much of my fortune to the poor.
Others know that.”</p>

<p>He raised his eyes feebly and turned his head
toward where Hera stood, in mute appeal. Comprehending,
she moved forward to speak, and
men and women fell back to make place for her.</p>

<p>“Yes; he has done more than you think,” she
began, impressively, standing by her husband’s
side. “A while ago you called me the friend of
the people. When you did that you were calling
my husband your friend. I did but distribute
his money. All that I had came from him.
Once, when I asked him for funds to carry on my
work of helping the poor, what do you think he
said?”</p>

<p>She paused, and Red Errico asked, sullenly:</p>

<p>“Well, what did he say?”</p>

<p>“These were his words: ‘My whole fortune is
at your disposal.’ And so it has been. He gave
to the needy with generous hand. My family<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
is poor. I had no fortune of my own. Believe
me, all that has been done for you in my name
has been done with his money. Men and women
of Milan, you do my husband a great injustice.”</p>

<p>She did her best to save him. No plea could
have carried deeper in that moment. That it
smothered, for the time, the flame of their temper,
cooled their wrath against him, was evinced in the
softening of their faces, the fading somewhat of
the frenzy in their eyes. And what might have
been the ending of the chapter is lost in its actual
outcome. Even as Hera spoke, the murmur of
the street changed to a multitude’s panic-stricken
cries. Those nearest the window were first to
catch the note of alarm. It caused them to start
and stand motionless, ears alert. The word
“soldiers” passed from lip to lip. Volleys of
musketry, ominously large, sounding in quick
succession, and crackling ever nearer, proclaimed
the approach of troops in overwhelming force.</p>

<p>An impulse to save their own lives ruled them
now. Red Errico began the cry of “Away, away!”
and the others took it up. With not so much as
a parting glance of contempt at Tarsis, the leader
shouldered the women aside and pushed toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
the door, with the others moving in that direction.
As they passed the man on the table they forgot
to jeer him. The resounding salvos of artillery,
the answering shrieks of the mob, coming to them
ever plainer from the Corso, were matters of
greater import than the baiting of a poor capitalist.</p>

<p>It was not so, however, with one woman in that
tattered collection&mdash;La Ferita. Her deed was
performed with the ease of instinctive prompting,
conviction, decision. She alone was aware of her
purpose. No one saw the blade steal from the
folds of her gown; they saw it only at the instant
that it flashed the light of the torches and descended,
true, firm, cold, resting a second, as if
with lingering joy, between the shoulders of
Tarsis.</p>

<p>“Let him die; he killed my child,” she said,
and joined the throng moving toward the door.</p>

<p>The effect of the thrust on the man who received
it was, oddly enough, to make him sit erect for
the moment, and it brought back to his countenance
some of the alertness that abject, crushing
terror had bereft it of; it was the animation of
strong surprise, puzzled amazement. Hera, whenever
she lived the scene again in memory, saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
that look of bewildered astonishment on his face
at the moment the blow was delivered. La Ferita’s
comrades seemed little impressed by what she had
done. They were fighting each other for a chance
to get out of the room&mdash;to flee from the soldiers.</p>

<span class="smaller">FETTERS STRUCK OFF</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> they all had gone Hera groped on the
wall for the electric key, found it, and redeemed
the darkness with a flood of light. There was
Tarsis, ashen to the lips, prostrate on the table,
one arm hanging limp over the side. She threw
open all the casements, and the smoke poured out.
Her next impulse was to go for aid, but she turned
first to her husband, lifted him to a sitting position,
and by a supreme effort bore his sheer weight to a
lounge. Then, obeying a motion of his hand, she
bowed her head and heard him whisper:</p>

<p>“I&mdash;am&mdash;dying.”</p>

<p>His lips continued to move, but so feeble was
his voice that only fragments of what he said
were audible. Seeing her strive to hear, he exerted
himself pitifully to speak louder, and she made
out the words:</p>

<p>“You will be glad when I am gone.”</p>

<p>Even to give him comfort in his last moments
she could not deny the truth of his words. “Destiny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
has served us cruelly,” she said. “I am
sorry&mdash;sorry for all that has come and gone. If
I have acted harshly, ungenerously, forgive, oh,
forgive me!”</p>

<p>A smile that chilled her blood just curved his
lip. “If you had not been so bitter against me,”
he answered, his voice gaining strength, “destiny
would have been kinder.”</p>

<p>“God help me if that is true!” she exclaimed.
“Oh, I tried to be&mdash;yes, I was&mdash;all that I promised.
If there was bitterness in my heart before, believe
me, it is not so now. If I have wronged you
grant me your pardon.”</p>

<p>A grimace that frightened her came over his
face, where death hues began to show. He rose
a little on one elbow, but sank back again, making
a gesture of distress.</p>

<p>“I will go for aid,” she said, and would have
left him, but he spoke, and she paused to listen.</p>

<p>“If I go <i>he</i> shall not live&mdash;he for whom you
hated me,” he said, with a passion of malice that
shook his frame. “He shall not live!”</p>

<p>She thought he meant that Mario would die
from his wound.</p>

<p>“He will die by my command. His end is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
decreed&mdash;decreed by me,” Tarsis went on with a
hideous chuckle.</p>

<p>Now she thought it the raving of a delirious
brain.</p>

<p>“You do not believe me,” he said, striving to
laugh. “But you will believe when you see his
white face in the night. By my hand he will die
within the hour.”</p>

<p>She turned away to shut out the sight of his
face.</p>

<p>“Still you do not believe,” she could hear him
saying. “You think I do not know; but I know.
You think he is safe. He is not. I saw him go
by. Yes; with my own eyes I saw him pass&mdash;a
moment before you came to the door. Now he
is on the way to the monastery&mdash;the monastery
where you held your trysts and deceived me; the
monastery where a knife awaits his heart.”</p>

<p>She wheeled suddenly, fearful now that he
spoke the truth. “What do you mean?” she
asked.</p>

<p>A paroxysm of agony stifled the words he tried
to speak. When it had passed somewhat he
answered, straining every resource of his ebbing
powers to the effort:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span></p>

<p>“I lured him to the monastery to-night. The
Panther will not fail. Not he! I did it&mdash;I!”</p>

<p>She comprehended, she believed. At her heart
a heavy aching began, the sinking sense of an
irreparable loss. She strangled a cry, and fell
upon her knees before the chair and buried her
face in her hands. And Tarsis, seeing her thus
affected, shook and choked with gloating
laughter.</p>

<p>“I wrote the letter,” he went on, in a pitiful
effort. “I copied your hand; the letter that bid
him go to you&mdash;and he has gone,&mdash;fool, dog that
bit me!&mdash;and you will not have him when I am
gone. I saw him pass&mdash;pass to his doom! He
thinks you are there awaiting him with your
kisses. The knife will be there! The kiss of
steel will greet him!”</p>

<p>She could not credit her senses. The man
lying there in the last breath of his life was
choking and laughing&mdash;a mocking, malevolent
laughter, as hideous a sound as human ear ever
heard. She shrank from him; she wished to
flee where neither eye could see that face, twitching
in hateful glee, nor ear know the horror of such
dying words. But soon enough his features and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
tongue became composed. The voices of the
street had dwindled to a dull rumble. She drew
near to him, and looked upon his face. On his
lip lingered a foam that no breath disturbed; and
in his open, staring eyes she read the message that
set her free.</p>

<p>She kneeled again and prayed, asking mercy
for him and pardon for herself if, in following the
light of conscience, she had wronged her husband.
When a little time had passed she rose and went
on the balcony to stand in the coolness of the
night. From the street came no longer sounds of
strife or pain; order reigned again in the dwelling
quarter of the well-to-do; with bullets and bayonets
the revolution had been driven across Cathedral
Square, back to the Porta Ticinese. The quieter
phase checked her whirling thoughts, helped her
to take facts at a clearer value. She had seen the
chain that held her parted, as a silken thread
might have been snapped, but only to give her
into a new bondage, that of despair, if what
Tarsis said was truth; nor could she doubt those
terrible words. Mario was well on his way.
More than half an hour before he had set out for
the monastery. It was too late, she perceived,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
to overtake him, unless&mdash;unless she rode like
the gale.</p>

<p>She thought of her horse and the hard-ridden
miles he had done that afternoon, and knew that
with him it would be impossible; but there was
the palace stable with its long rows of horses, and
some of them fleet-footed under the saddle, as
she knew. The thought kindled a beautiful hope.
Her lips set in the firmness of resolve; she threw
a glance toward the lounge with its silent occupant,
and started for the door. Over the wreckage
of the grand saloon she made her way without
mischance, for the moon was sending its flood
through the glass dome; there was a streaming
of light, too, from the corridor, and she beheld a
man standing in the doorway arch wringing his
hands. It was Beppe, quaking from causes other
than fright.</p>

<p>He assured her Excellency that he was not one
of those who had deserted the palace; he had done
no more than observe the precaution to secrete
himself in the wine cellar that he might be at
hand when the master wanted him. The velvet
had gone from his voice and the steadiness from
his speech. Plainly he had not been idle while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
hiding amid the bottles. With an upward roll of
the eyes and more wringing of the hands, he gasped
the wish that no harm had befallen Signor Tarsis.</p>

<p>Hera pointed across the great hall to where the
light poured from the library, and kept on her way.
In her veins there was a new leaping of life&mdash;hopeful,
eager. The invaders had swung their
axes and bludgeons at the corridor mirrors, and
she had to choose her steps over broken glass and
shattered woodwork. The grand staircase was
illuminated; there and in the portico she met
servants returning because assured that the storm
had passed.</p>

<p>In the rear court she looked around for her
horse. The shapes of things all about were
visible in the moonlight, but of her horse there
was no sign. Lamps were lit in the stables, and
she heard the excited voices of hostlers. When
she told the head man to saddle the swiftest horse,
he asked her Excellency’s pardon and pointed
to the rows of empty stalls. While the rioters
within the palace were reforming society by
destroying art objects and baiting their owner,
their brothers below had been plundering the
stable. Every horse was gone.</p>

<span class="smaller">A CHASE IN THE MOONLIGHT</span></h2></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hera</span> asked if the automobiles, too, were gone.
The excited servants told her the garage had been
attacked and everything smashed. Had any one
seen Sandro? Yes; he was there looking through
the ruins. She ran to the door of the place, and
called the name of the chauffeur. From amid
the wreckage he answered her, and came forth,
cap in hand.</p>

<p>“Are all the machines damaged?” she asked.</p>

<p>“All but one, your Excellency. The thirty-horse
touring car is far back in the house, and the
devils did not get to it.”</p>

<p>“Can it be used at once?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, your Excellency. There is not so
much as a scratch upon it.”</p>

<p>“I wish to go to Villa Barbiondi as swiftly as
you can make it carry us.”</p>

<p>“The moon is bright, and if the road is half
clear,” he said, delighted with the hazardous
mission, “we can do it in thirty minutes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span></p>

<p>Then he called to the hostlers and other servants
to come and clear away the useless cars, for Donna
Hera was going to make a dash in the night. With
a will they fell to, and one wreck after another
was dragged out of the garage. Sandro touched
something in the surviving machine, and smiled
to hear it respond with coughs and sobs. He took
a minute to crawl under it, measure things with
critical eye by the light of an electric lantern, and
was on his feet again throwing in lap cloths and
handing a mask to Hera. He sprang in, pulled
the lever and shot the machine out to the court.
Once or twice he ran it back and forth, cutting
figures after the manner of fancy skaters, and with
a satisfied “All right” he descended again and
opened the door for Hera. When she had her
seat it was touch and go. With the hostlers
standing wide-eyed, and Beppe, no longer tipsy,
running from the portico big with the news of
what he had found in the library, the car
swung out of the court, headed for the Venetian
Gate.</p>

<p>“I wish you to make the best speed that you
can,” Hera said, when they were bumping over
the cobbles of Via Borghetto.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span></p>

<p>He patted the air reassuringly as he glanced
back at her. “Your Excellency need have no
anxiety,” he said. “Leave it to me.”</p>

<p>As he spoke they leaped into a swifter pace, and
this was held in the Corso and through the streets
beyond the walls; but when the crowds of soldiers
and civilians were behind them, and Hera sighted
once more the far horizon, set with stars, he sent
the speed lever home and, like a spurred horse,
the machine plunged out upon the wide, white
road. In the suburb of Villacosa she received
an impression of dimly-lighted street, carbineers
and gesturing workmen, bare heads at windows,
barking dogs, and a thumping rise and fall over a
cobbled bridge.</p>

<p>A few seconds and all this was far at their back,
and they were spinning over plains that stretched
in the silver night for miles on either hand, level
as a table. Now and then they came upon a
market wagon labouring along, but the way was
wide, and they curved around it like a shooting
star.</p>

<p>The wind had swept all the clouds from heaven;
only a few vapours thin as the moonlight flitted
across the stars; to footfarers the wind did no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
more than whisper; for Hera and Sandro it was a
gale that whipped around them with a high, thin
yell and caught up the powder of the road and
smote them with it in clouds that must have
blinded but for their masks.</p>

<p>They swerved northward into a narrow byway
that was a short crossing to the road that followed
Adda’s margin. It was a precipitate dive into
the woods. There was no light save that cast
by the car’s lamps, and the course was difficult
with many a sharp crook. Every minute they
were on the point of vaulting into the thicket or
trying conclusions with a sturdy oak. They
rocked and swayed at times as if their carrier was
a boat in a choppy sea. Hera was occupied in
holding fast, but Sandro seemed not to know that
the experience was at all unusual. Forgetting
himself and all the world except the road and the
dangers that the lamps revealed, he became a
part of the dodging, spinning thing, meeting
emergencies with a passive certainty that was
more automatic than human. He had seen in
Hera’s eye that more than a lady’s caprice had
inspired this nocturnal flight, and he had prayed
that none of his steed’s airy feet might know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
puncture, or heart-failure attack it through the
carbureter.</p>

<p>When they had struck again into a straight run,
and through the vista of foliage could see the
river’s sheening face, Sandro shouted, in an access
of pride for his achievement:</p>

<p>“It was very amusing, that little bit there!
I know my trade, do I not, your Excellency?”</p>

<p>Hera gave him an appreciative smile and a nod,
although he had not made his words carry above
the roar and yell that were with them always.</p>

<p>The wheels on one side clear of the earth, they
rounded a corner and darted forth on the fine
river road. Now the way was as level as a plank.
Sandro moved the speed lever, and the file of
poplars, yards apart, chased away like giants close
upon one another’s heels. Houses on the passing
hillside, with lighted windows, winked at them
and were gone. All the details of the landscape
were on the move. Villages streamed by in
jumbled masses of low masonry.</p>

<p>The bridge of Speranza swept past to join other
landmarks, and Hera caught sight of a horseman,
so far ahead as to be beyond the range of the lamps
but showing distinctly in the paleness of the night.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
Standing up and leaning forward so that she
might pour all the power of her voice against
Sandro’s ear-drum, she told him to “Stop!”
It was two miles yet to Villa Barbiondi, and he
answered her with only an assurance that there
was no danger. And not until she had shaken
him by the shoulder and pointed to the figure
now in the lamp glare did he shut off speed and
set his brake down.</p>

<p>The rider had gone from the highway into the
little road that ran uphill to the monastery ruins.
Within a few feet of the turning Sandro brought
the car to a halt. He looked around for the
lady, but she had disengaged herself from the
lap covering, thrown off the mask, and was on the
ground, running toward the horseman. With
all her strength she called his name, and the
grove of maples into whose darkness he had
passed gave back her voice.</p>

<p>“Mario, Mario! It is I, Hera!”</p>

<p>He heard, and his horse, checked violently,
reared and curvetted in turning, then came
toward her at a gallop, out into the moonlight.
Quickly she told him of the emancipating event
in Milan and the dying words that had sent her to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
warn him; but there was no bitterness for any one
now in either heart. All the world was love for
the man and woman standing there beneath the
stars, prisoners of honour and despair suddenly
made free. The shadow of a solitary yew tree
touched them&mdash;a symbol of what had been. The
lonely cry of a bird sounded; somewhere in the
distance a dog barked; and as they started for the
highway a swishing of leafy bush drew their gaze
toward a figure with loping carriage that slunk
away toward the bridge of Speranza. He never
looked back, but went like a panther balked of
his prey.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When a year had passed they met once more in
the cloister ruins, amid the sleeping fragrance of
the wild flowers. As careless children they
roamed in the age-old garden, thrilled with the
thought of Love set free. The afternoon had
faded far; the sun touched only the capitals of the
low Doric columns, where ivy and honeysuckle
cleaved and iridescent sun-birds dipped into
flowery cups. The gentlest wind that ever tried
its wings stole in by the clefts of grey wall and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
made the tiny white bells of the vale lilies tremble.
Bees murmured over the tufts of fragrant thyme.</p>

<p>Once they wandered a little apart, she to cull
the blooms of a strawberry plant, he to pluck
white and pink and gold from the many grasses
for the garland that she said she would make;
and they called to one another over the bushes
in sheer transport of joy. They came upon a
bud of eglantine, called by them <i>rosa salvatica</i>,
but for their garland they did not take it, because
it was a symbol of love unfulfilled.</p>

<p>A while and they left the bright aspect of the
cloister to enter the gloom of the chapel, he
carrying the big cluster of blossoms. Suddenly
she turned and looked back, and with a little cry
ran to regain the hat she had tossed on a grassy
bank; and the trifle was enough to set their
laughter pealing again.</p>

<p>They moved to the window near the square of
blank wall where Arvida’s portrait had been.
For a space they stood there, while the west
caught first the faint hue of rose, then flamed in
ruby fire. His kiss was fresh upon her lips, and
in their eyes the ardour of a passion no longer to
be conquered. From a far-off hamlet, where a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
steeple rose out of the haze, the Angelus came to
them; they watched the toilers bow their heads
in reverence and plod their way homeward. The
broad landscape lay in the mysterious hush of
folding night, but they took no thought for time
or circumstance. They seated themselves on a
low stone bench of the pattern that mediæval
builders were wont to carry around the interior
walls of churches. He joined the ends of the garland
to fashion a chaplet, and, placing it on her
massing tresses, crowned her his queen forever.</p>

<p>Baroness Orczy needs no introduction to lovers of
good fiction. The scene of her new story is Hungary&mdash;the
hero a handsome young peasant who, having inherited
a fortune from his thrifty father, is enabled to
save a Hungarian nobleman from losing all his lands,
and in return receives the hand of the lord’s daughter
whom he has long worshipped from afar. Immediately
after the wedding the peasant bridegroom
discovers that his wife despises him and has merely
allowed herself to be sold as payment of her father’s
debt. How he tries to overcome this feeling and
what effect his generous and big-hearted nature finally
has upon her must be left for the reader to find out
for himself. Like <i>The Scarlet Pimpernel</i>, the present
story is of intense dramatic interest and shows great
emotional strength.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
